<h2><a href="#16TOC" name="16">16. News transport gotcha's</a></h2>
<p>
   There are a few quirks in the network news transport software that
   you might encounter, and should be aware of.  What follows is far
   from a complete list but does include the ones most commonly
   encountered.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#16TOC" name="16.1">16.1. Line lengths</a></h2>
<p>
   The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025645/http://www.academ.com/academ/nntp/">NNTP reference implementation</a>
   package in use on the Internet has a limit on the number of
   characters that an individual line may contain.  Submissions
   containing lines longer than 512 bytes will be corrupted because the
   reference servers will truncate the lines longer than 512 bytes.
<p>
   In general you should limit your individual line lengths to 79
   characters or less if possible.  Systems that have fixed record
   lengths, such as some BITNET IBM servers, can drop text longer than
   that.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#16TOC" name="16.2">16.2. Old C News blanks-in-ng bug</a></h2>
<p>
   If there is a newsgroup line in an article like this

<p align="CENTER"><strong>Newsgroups: comp.unmoderated, comp.moderated</strong></p>

   some older versions of C News fail to skip the space after the comma
   and so only see the group "comp.moderated" which of course is not
   moderated and passes it along.  When the message hits a B News site,
   the space is squeezed out, the moderated group is seen for the first
   time and the message gets mailed in.  This has been fixed in later C
   News releases, but sites running older software will still act this
   way.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#16TOC" name="16.3">16.3. B News non-local unapproved articles bug</a></h2>
<p>
   As mentioned in <a href="/web/20071021025645/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod05.html">Section 5</a>,
   most news servers will automatically
   forward unapproved postings to the moderator.  This should only occur
   for local postings, otherwise, situations can occur where the
   moderator gets far more than one copy of the same article. B News
   forwards non-local articles too.  This coupled with the old C News
   blanks-in-ng bug has been responsible for moderators being deluged
   with hundreds of copies of an article.  It's particularly nasty when
   the newsgroup has been recently unmoderated and not every server has
   respected the control message and the ex-moderator gets bombed.
<p>

   To be fair, the B News behavior of mailing unapproved non-local
   articles to the moderator was not a "bug".  It was a "feature".

<p>
   It used to be that B News was the only game in town.  It used to be
   that people ran ancient software versions forever. In such an
   environment, it was useful for a site receiving an article that
   should have gone to the moderator to assume that the previous hosts
   were running old software, and do the moderator-send itself.  That is
   not the case today.
<p>

   This bug has not been fixed, and never will be because B News is no
   longer being supported.  Fortunately, B News is dying out.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#16TOC" name="16.4">16.4. Article size concerns</a></h2>
<p>
   In some places, such as small systems and news-to-mail gateways,
   there are problems when individual article sizes exceed software
   limits.  We need to either remove builtin system limitations or work
   around them.  Since it takes time to remove old software versions and
   overcome hardware limitations netwide, the best course of action is
   to work around the limitations so that the news will get to all
   sites.
<p>
   Individual postings should be less than or equal to 60K.  If it is
   necessary to split the posting into multiple parts, each part should
   be less than or equal to 60K.   This is  due to the  architecture
   restrictions of some older systems.  This restriction is more in the
   minds of the users on the net than the software running it.  Postings
   of 90K successfully make it through most present day news systems.
   Many mail systems have limitations of 100K on messages that pass
   through them.  This is a concern because there are news to mail
   gateways that deliver and post news via electronic mail.
<p>
   Note that some commercial gateways to the Internet have broken news
   and mail software that truncate anything over around 25K.  Most are
   in the process of correcting their sub-standard software but at this
   point that has not been universally accomplished.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#16TOC" name="16.5">16.5. Amount of messages posted daily</a></h2>
<p>
   Moderators of high volume newsgroups should try to limit the amount
   of data posted per day so as not to flood news spool directories on
   smaller systems.  A good rule of thumb is to limit posting to 800K
   per day if possible.
<p>

   If you are overwhelmed with posts on one day, it may be better to
   hold some articles back until the next day.  Articles can be posted
   either in chronological order, or grouped by subject.  On the other
   hand, it is not a good idea to loosen your acceptance standards
   simply because fewer articles were submitted in a given time period -
   in most cases it is better to have lower volume than lower quality.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#16TOC" name="16.6">16.6. Cross-posting to other moderated groups</a></h2>
<p>
   None of the NetNews software handles cross-posted moderation very
   well, largely because there is no consensus on what the correct
   action is.  What actually happens is that the posting software picks
   one of the moderated groups more or less at random (usually the first
   moderated group) and mails the message to its moderator. If the
   posting software used by the moderator who received the article does
   not check for other moderated newsgroups, the article will appear in
   the newsgroup of the other moderated group without being approved by
   the appropriate moderator.
<p>

   Moderators should try to bullet-proof the posting software by making
   it check cross-posting to multiple moderated groups. But until
   NetNews gets a far more sophisticated posting scheme, e.g., one that
   lets a moderator add a new newsgroup to a message already in
   circulation, glitches like this will happen.
<p>

   Remember that it is often VERY desirable to cross-post among
   moderated newsgroups:
<strong>
<ul>
      <lh>comp.sources.misc "list of sources" also goes to comp.archives
      <br>comp.sources.misc "intro posting" also goes to news.answers
      </lh>
</ul>
</strong>
   Many of the postings in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025645/news:news.answers">news.answers</a> are cross-posted into the group from other moderated groups.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#16TOC" name="16.7">16.7. Extra headers on directly posted articles</a></h2>
<p>
   Some submissions will arrive with two sets of headers.  The "real"
   headers will be a set of generic mail headers; the news headers will
   be included as text within the body of the mail message.  Even worse,
   in these cases the mail headers may indicate that the article is
   "From" usenet@site or news@site, making it difficult to identify or
   respond to the actual author.
<p>

   This is the article-headers-in-body problem caused by C News feeding
   the article into UCB Mail or mailx instead of /bin/mail, which
   usually incorporates the news headers into the mail header.
<p>
   Explanation: in C News, the newsbin/relay/injnews script is used by
   inews to do site-specific header bashing.  When it discovers the
   newsgroup is moderated, it invokes mail to send off the article to
   the moderator (via mailpaths).  Unlike B News and INN, where time has
   been spent to configure how to use the mail transport directly (to
   merge the news headers in with the mail headers), C News blindly
   punts the article into "mail" which is a user agent, which often
   refuses to accept "header-like" stuff at the beginning of a message
   as part of the <a href="/web/20071021025645/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</a> header block.  
   In essence, mail will often
   implicitly put a blank line at the beginning of the message, so the
   headers carefully crafted by injnews end up as part of the body
   instead of the mail headers.
<p>
   If this becomes a problem for you, it would be appropriate to send a
   message to usenet@ and/or postmaster@ at the offending site with a
   suggestion on how to fix their C News injnews script.
<p>
   [See <a href="/web/20071021025645/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/appendixB.html">Appendix B</a>
   for a description of the solution.  A template message is included that 
   will allow you to inform the offending site of both the problem and the 
   solution.]

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#16TOC" name="16.8">16.8. Multiple copies of the same submission received</a></h2>
<p>
   There are a number of different reasons why you may get many copies
   of a submission:
<ul>
     <li>A mailer or gateway bug that keeps resending the same message
         (distinguished by having the same sites in "Received by" headers).
<p>
     <li>The posting site doesn't have the group marked as moderated
         (usually you only get a few extra copies of the message, all
         with short "Path" headers, if any).
<p>
     <li>Interaction with the C-news problem when there is a space
         in the list of newsgroups; when it gets to a B-news site,
         the space is squashed out and the moderated group is
         recognized (there are multiple newsgroups in the header,
         and your moderated group is not the first in the list).
<p>
     <li>Submitter was unaware that the group was moderated and
         repeatedly attempted to post the article to the group
         since their article did not immediately appear in their
         local newsgroup.
</ul>
   Contacting the administrator of the site where the problem posting
   was generated is probably a good first step.

<h2><a href="#16TOC" name="16.9">16.9. B News static Newsgroup: header limit</a></h2>
<p>
   B News inews has a static limit of 256 bytes for header lines.  One
   might think that this limits Newsgroups: headers to about 254 bytes,
   but unfortunately the practical limit is lower than that.  The Xref:
   header, which is generated from the Newsgroups: line plus article
   numbers, is longer than the Newsgroups: header.  If the Xref: header
   at a particular site is longer than 256 bytes, the article simply
   will not appear at that site.
<p>
   Since the length of the same article's Xref: header varies from site
   to site, and cannot be easily computed in advance, it is necessary to
   leave some spare room in the Newsgroups: header.  Set a fair limit on
   the size of the Newsgroups: header, and make a policy prohibiting
   cross-posting to more groups than will fit on the line.  Some
   moderators have decided on a 200-character limit for the entire
   Newsgroups: line.
