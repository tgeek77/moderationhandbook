<h2><a href="#BTOC" name="B">Appendix B: Canned Messages</a></h2>
<p>
   All moderators get a certain amount of wildly off-topic submissions,
   and it helps to have a form letter that you can send to clueless
   folks, without having to take the time to figure out why they might
   have been posting to your group, or where they should have sent
   their post, or whether it was their brain or their software that
   erred.
<p>
   Here are a few types of canned responses that you may want to have
   handy to save you time and effort:
<ul>
   <li>Read the FAQ, where the question you asked is answered.
<p>
   <li>Your message wasn't posted because it was similar to several
       other messages just posted, but thanks anyway.
<p>
   <li>Your question was answered by past messages, here's how to
       look in the archives.
<p>
   <li>You have been taken off the mailing list [if your group
       is two-way gatewayed to a BITNET list] because mail to you
       bounced.  If your mail now works go ahead and resubscribe.
<p>
   <li>To subscribe or unsubscribe to the mailing list, send a
       message to blah.
<p>
   <li>Your message was cross-posted to other moderated newsgroups
       and the policy of this newsgroup is no cross-posting.  It
       appeared on this one but no others.
<p>
   <li>Various responses pointing people at on-line resources.
</ul>
   When a spamming message is received, just throw it away with no
   response at all, particularly if it was cross-posted to a bunch of
   equally irrelevant groups.  There is no reason to alert the spammer
   to the fact that the message wasn't posted.  If it seems like it
   might be useful, send a polite note to <strong>usenet@</strong> or 
   the <strong>postmaster@</strong> the spammer's site.

<h2><a href="#BTOC" name="B.1">B.1. C News Duplicate headers message template</a></h2>
<em>
<p>
   Dear postmaster/usenet administrator:
<p>

   I am the moderator of &lt;insert your group here&gt;.  I receive emailed
   submissions for the group.  As I get a lot of submissions, it can
   sometimes be rather time consuming to get incoming articles ready
   for posting.  You appear to be running C News, which has the
   annoying habit of inserting duplicate sets of headers when the
   transport software sends the posting from your user to me.  While
   a single posting like this isn't a problem by itself, after the
   100th or 1000th time it gets rather tiresome, and it's *very*
   simple to fix.

<p>
   Explanation: in C News, the newsbin/relay/injnews script is used
   by inews to do site-specific header bashing.  When it discovers
   that the newsgroup is moderated, it invokes mail to send off
   the article to the moderator (via mailpaths).  Unlike B News and
   INN, where time has been spent to configure how to use the mail
   transport directly (to merge the news headers in with the mail
   headers), C News blindly punts the article into "mail" which is
   a user agent, which often refuses to accept "header-like" stuff
   at the beginning of a message as part of the RFC 822 header block.
   In essence, mail will often implicitly put a blank line at the
   beginning of the message, so the headers carefully crafted by
   injnews end up as part of the body instead of the mail headers.

<p>
   The solution is simple - change injnews to call the mailer
   (usually the transport) in such a way that injnews' headers
   are included in the mail headers.  In relaynews/injnews, there
   is the following line:

<p align="CENTER"> mail "$moderator" &lt;$censart</p>

   Change it to call the mail transport directly.  If you're
   using sendmail or smail, simply change "mail" to be the
   full path.  Eg:

<p align="CENTER">/usr/lib/sendmail "$moderator" &lt;$censart</p>

   Most other transports, such as MMDF or PP should be just as
   simple.  Please note that injnews is intended to be modified for
   local site policy, so you won't be voiding your warranty ;-)
<p>
   If you're not using sendmail or smail, or simply wish to test
   this, try typing:
<p>
          &lt;your mail transport program &lt;your address&gt;
          Subject: it worked
<p>
          hello
<p>
   It should appear in your mailbox with Subject: properly
   recognized.  If the subject isn't recognized, then it
   didn't work, and "Subject: it worked" will appear in the
   body.
<p>
   If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
   Thank you for your time,
</em>

<p>

   If you are new to Usenet, you should probably read the posts in
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:news.announce.newusers">news.announce.newusers</a> (n.a.n.) -- if they are not available in your
   newsreader, they also available by anonymous FTP in
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/file://rtfm.mit.edu//pub/usenet/news.announce.newusers/">rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.announce.newusers/</a>*

<p>
   To find what groups are relevant for your question, you might scan
   through your local list of newsgroups (your .newsrc file on most Unix
   systems), to see which group names seem related.  Then subscribe to
   those groups, and look at some of the recent traffic, to make sure
   that your question is suitable for the group.  (For example, questions
   about Microsoft Windows belong in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:comp.os.ms-windows">comp.os.ms-windows</a>.*, not
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:comp.windows">comp.windows</a>.*)

<p>
   On some systems, you will be able to look at a file containing a
   one-line description of the purpose of each newsgroup (the
   'newsgroups' file), or at a longer description of the purpose and
   contents of each newsgroup (the newsgroup charters.)  Ask your local
   news administrator if these resources are available on your system.
<p>
   For widely-distributed newsgroups, you can also find the one-line
   descriptions in the following n.a.n postings:

   The 'List' posts describe newsgroups in the comp, misc, news, rec,
   soc, sci, and talk hierarchies. The 'Alt' posts describe newsgroups
   in the alt, bionet, bit, biz, clarinet, gnu, hepnet, ieee, inet, info,
   k12, relcom, u3b, and vmsnet hierarchies.  They will not describe
   groups that are available only in your region or institution.
<p>

   If these sources of information do not suggest some newsgroups which
   might be appropriate for your questions, you may wish to post on the
   newsgroup <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:news.groups.questions">news.groups.questions</a>, whose charter includes helping users
   find newsgroups appropriate for their questions. Please consult the
   above-listed sources before posting on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:news.groups.questions">news.groups.questions</a>, however.

<p>
   Very few sites carry all available newsgroups.  Your local newsadmin
   can help you access newsgroups that are not currently available, or
   explain why certain groups are not available at your site.  If your
   site does not carry the newsgroup(s) where your post belongs, do NOT
   post it in other, inappropriate groups.
<p>

   Think very carefully before cross-posting to more than one, or perhaps
   two, newsgroups.  It is considered highly inappropriate to broadcast
   your message to a wide selection of newsgroups merely to have more
   people read it.  Follow the general rules of Netiquette (Usenet
   etiquette) described in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:news.announce.newusers">news.announce.newusers</a> postings above.

<p>
   Once you decide what newsgroup(s) are relevant to your question, make
   sure that you're not asking questions that are frequently asked and
   answered.  In addition to looking at recent traffic in the group,
   check whether your question is included in an FAQ (Frequently
   Asked/Answered Questions) list.  Most FAQs are archived at
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/">rtfm.mit.edu</a>, in directory /pub/usenet/your.group.name, if they're
   not available in your newsreader in the specific group or in
   *.answers.  Many groups also have a periodic introductory post that
   describes the content and purpose of the newsgroup - if one exists,
   you should read it before posting.
<p>

   A listing of many of the periodical postings on Usenet can be found
   in n.a.n. or its archives, as

   Following these suggestions will help not only to ensure that your
   post reaches its intended audience, but to make Usenet more useful
   for all of us.

   to the *.test newsgroups are automatically acknowledged by daemons
   running at many sites.  If you want to test your site set up for
   posting to a moderated group, post your test message to the group
