<h2><a href="#13TOC" name="13">13. Creating Periodic Informational Postings</a></h2>
<p>
   One of the best ways to communicate with your readership, as well as
   a tool for saving you time, is via a policy posting, and potentially
   additional <a href="/web/20071021065305/http://www.landfield.com/faqs/">Frequently Asked Questions postings (FAQ)</a>.
<p>
   A policy posting is an article that describes how you will run the
   newsgroup.  It should include information describing the use of any
   additional Auxiliary header lines, how and where articles should be
   submitted, and general guidelines for the group (often including the
   charter) used by you in performing the responsibilities as the
   newsgroup's moderator.
<p>
   Other things that might be included are:
<p>
<ul>
      <li>How you will deal with cross-posted submissions,
<p>
      <li>How postings of a commercial nature will be dealt with,
<p>
      <li>Use of backup or multiple moderators,
<p>
      <li>Items concerning the group that have been hashed out via
          the group or moderator lead surveys,
<p>
      <li>Where to obtain a current copy of the informational postings
          outside of the newsgroup.  If possible, an email location or
          mailserver should be included, since not all users have FTP
          capabilities,
<p>
      <li>A list of sites, if any, that archive the group as well as
          how to become an archive site,
<p>
      <li>Moderator conflict resolution methods,
<p>
      <li>Moderator replacement policy.
</ul>

   This posting should be made periodically to the group.
<p>
   Your group may be best served by having both a periodic policy
   posting and an FAQ.  Quite often it becomes necessary to have a
   Frequently Asked Questions posting. Readers drop in and out of
   newsgroups frequently, and may not be familiar with previous
   discussions.  A FAQ posting can help reduce the number of duplicate
   questions submitted to the newsgroup.
<p>
   FAQ posting(s) do not have to be written, or even directly posted, by
   the primary moderator.  Many moderated groups have a group of
   relevant FAQs posted, written by a number of authors.  It is
   perfectly acceptable to simply give an FAQ author permission to post
   or cross-post the FAQ into your newsgroup.  All the poster needs to
   do is add the appropriate Approved: header to the FAQ posting.  (Of
   course, if the moderator gives others permission to post to the
   group, automatic cancellation software, if used, should not cancel
   those articles.)
<p>
   More suggestions about writing and maintaining FAQs, as well as
   information about automatic FAQ-posting software, can be gotten from
   the <strong>faq-maintainers@faqs.org</strong> mailing list.  To subscribe, send a message to

   <p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/mailto:faq-maintainers-request@faqs.org">faq-maintainers-request@faqs.org</a></p>

   There is a good deal of information about writing FAQs and the FAQ posting 
   process available from

   <p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/http://www.faqs.org/authors.html">http://www.faqs.org/authors.html</a></p>

   Having these types of documents as a consistent part of the group
   will save you from answering the same questions again and again. The
   readership will be able to get the majority of the information about
   the group from the group itself.  When people submit requests for
   information that has already been covered, it is easy to simply
   forward the appropriate informational posting to them, or send them a
   pointer to it.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#13TOC" name="13.1">13.1. Copyright</a></h2>
<p>

   Recently there has been a lot of discussion about implicit and
   explicit copyrights on policy and FAQ postings.  This has become an
   issue, in part, due to the increasing number of CD-ROM vendors and
   Internet How-To book authors, who reproduce informational postings in
   commercial products, with or without obtaining the permission of the
   authors or maintainers.
<p>

   It is wise to document your copyright and any distribution
   restrictions within your periodic postings.  In most cases you should
   try to be as open as possible.  The purpose of the newsgroups is to
   communicate information to the community at large. Your information
   is probably archived and available in many ways and places that you
   are not aware of; it does not make a lot of sense to be overly
   sensitive to one particular use of postings that have already been
   broadcast freely all over the world.  Remember that copyright laws
   can vary widely among the many countries where your posting goes.

<p>
   If asked, it is up to you if you want to see your group's
   informational postings included.  A suggestion might be to send a
   message back such as:

<p>
<hr width="400" align="CENTER">
<p>
<strong>
<em>
      I give you permission to use my FAQ for the group 'your.group' as
      you have requested with the following additional conditions:
<ol>
     <li>You state explicitly that the information in the FAQ may
         not be entirely correct or up to date. That information
         should not be used directly without first checking it out.
         FAQ information is only a guideline.
<p>
     <li>Do not change the content of the FAQ in any way but may
         reformat it to better integrate with your production media.
<p>
     <li>Assure that credit is given as appropriate.
<p>
     <li>You send me a free copy of the {book/cdrom...}
</ol>

</em>
</strong>
<p>
<hr width="400" align="CENTER">
<p>
   This is just a suggested starting point; feel free to modify it as
   needed to suit your policies.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#13TOC" name="13.2">13.2. Frequency of distribution and news.answers</a></h2>
<p>
   You will need to determine how often your informational postings are
   actually posted to your group.  Sources groups post them at the
   beginning of each new volume in the archives.  Discussion and
   announcement group moderators may decide to post them on a periodic
   basis, usually once a month.  The policy statement should document
   how often informational posting are done.  If there are many requests
   for the FAQ, or repeats of FAQ information, it may make sense to post
   the FAQ more often, or to frequently post an explanation of how to
   obtain the FAQ or policy posting.
<p>

   It is strongly suggested that your policy posting and any FAQ have a
   consistent Subject: line every time that it is posted, to assist
   readers in recognizing it.
<p>

   You may also want to consider cross-posting your informational
   postings to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/news:news.answers">news.answers</a> and the other appropriate *.answers
   newsgroups.  This requires the prior approval of the *.answers
   moderators.  The process is fairly easy, and is described in the
   posting

   The basic requirements for cross-posting to *.answers, above basic
   compliance with RFC 1036, are meeting the *.answers standards for the
   consistent content of a few of the standard header lines, and the
   addition of an auxiliary header containing an Archive-name:  header.
   There are no format restrictions whatsoever on the contents of
   postings to *.answers.

<p>
   The *.answers groups are archived on
