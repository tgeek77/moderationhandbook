<h2><a href="#17TOC" name="17">17. How to deal with your readership</a></h2>
<p>
   Moderators need to take the time to figure out how they wish their
   newsgroup to be perceived on the net.  Some of this is forced upon
   the moderator by the group's charter but much of it is up to the
   moderator.  Are you planning on being proactive in keeping
   discussions going and on track ?  Do you see yourself only as a
   filter for the group hoping to keep yourself totally in the shadows ?
   Or do you plan to be somewhere in the middle of the two ?  And how
   will you deal with the submitters ?  Much of the perceived success in
   being a moderator is how your deal with your group's readership.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#17TOC" name="17.1">17.1. Personality of your group</a></h2>

<p align="CENTER"><strong>This is up to you as the moderator to determine.</strong></p>

   The whole point of having a moderator is to act as a filter, so you
   don't get 20 copies of the origin of "foobar" all posted.  In
   general, you decide:
<ul>
         <li>Which submissions are appropriate for the newsgroup,
         <li>What format to post them in,
         <li>What order to post things in,
         <li>Whether to edit the submissions,
         <li>How, or in what directions to steer the discussion.
</ul>
   For example: because of the very restrictive charter of
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065408/news:news.announce.important">news.announce.important</a>, submissions accepted and posted to the group
   should be articles that are SO important that nearly everyone on
   Usenet should read them.  For this reason almost all postings are
   rejected.  The moderator often suggests to the submitter that the
   submission instead belongs in another group, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065408/news:news.misc">news.misc</a>.
<p>
   However, for most discussion newsgroups, you'll probably want to let
   almost everything through; otherwise you can get a reputation as a
   tyrant or censor.  Most moderators try to help the author say what
   they really meant; if the original submission isn't clear you can
   suggest changes, or suggest a different place where it might belong.
   If you get duplicates, pick the best one and post it, perhaps along
   with an editorial note thanking A, B and C for their similar answer.
<p>
   If you get a high noise/signal ratio, you can delete some of the
   noise (like extra mail headers or signature lines).  If the poster
   asks a question that you know the answer to, it's common to post the
   question and give the answer right there in an editorial note 
   <strong>[such notes are generally in brackets, like this - MRH.]</strong>
<p>
   Other common editorial practices are to remove excessive quoted
   material, and to reformat paragraphs to be under 80 columns per line.
   (Some moderators return articles to the author for such reformatting,
   though.)
<p>
   If you want to have a lively discussion (or discussions) going, you
   might group related notes (possibly into a digest) and pass almost
   everything through.  If your goal is to improve the quality of the
   newsgroup (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065408/news:rec.humor.funny">rec.humor.funny</a> does for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065408/news:rec.humor">rec.humor</a>) you might be very
   selective.
<p> 
<hr>
<h2><a href="#17TOC" name="17.2">17.2. Deciding a course of action</a></h2> 
<p> 
   There are times when you may not know the best way to handle an issue
   or policy.  You cannot always be sure what the newsgroup's readership
   actually wants to see happen.  When a significant question or
   controversy arises, you should consider running a survey of the
   readers to determine the appropriate course of action.  Surveys can
   be extremely useful, not only for determining what people want to
   happen on a specific issue, but for the other benefits they can
   provide:
<ul>
     <li>Once it is documented what the readers want, it is much
         easier to explain to the malcontents why you need to reject
         their submissions.
<p>
     <li>Readers feel the moderator is listening, and allowing them
         to help improve the group.
<p>
     <li>Often you receive other comments that are not a part of the
         issue on the table that you find useful to incorporate into
         your group's moderation.
</ul>

<p> 
<hr>
<h2><a href="#17TOC" name="17.3">17.3. Commonly perceived problems with moderation</a></h2> 
<p> 
   <strong>Censorship</strong> - People are afraid they won't be able to get 
   their idea out to the masses if the moderator doesn't like it.  You are 
   strongly discouraged from ever telling someone 
   <em>"I don't think this should be posted to the net"</em> when you get 
   a submission. It's almost always possible to say <em>"toplevel.mygroup 
   isn't the right place, have you considered net.framus?"</em>
<p>
   We should also emphasize that only the moderated groups are affected,
   the unmoderated groups will still exist for those who want total
   freedom and lower quality or higher volume. (Hopefully you'll be able
   to take some of these high volume newsgroups and reduce their volume
   to a manageable level, along with increased organization.)  This is
   only true for groups that are paralleled by unmoderated groups.
<p>
   <strong>Time delays</strong> -  When someone posts something to an 
   unmoderated group, most of the net sees it within two days.  When 
   submitted to a moderator, you introduce a delay, and you submit to the 
   net from a different place which might introduce an additional delay.  
   Depending on the nature of your group, it may be very important that you
   process submissions promptly.  A lively discussion will die out if
   turnaround is worse than about one day.  On the other hand, groups
   such as comp.sources.* and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065408/news:rec.humor.funny">rec.humor.funny</a> probably can easily
   tolerate more delays. There have been moderators who've gotten way
   behind on traffic; the result has been bad feelings toward the
   moderator, and in extreme cases, a newsgroup that dies out.
<p> 
<hr>
<h2><a href="#17TOC" name="17.4">17.4. Vocal minority</a></h2> 
<p> 
   As moderator of a newsgroup, prepare to be flamed by a vocal
   minority.  Assuming you do your job reasonably well, most of the
   satisfied readers will remain silent.  Whether you deserve it or not,
   you will receive annoyed criticism from readers typically of the
   form:
<strong>
<ul>
   <li>Why did you reject my article?
   <li>Who made you God?
   <li>How dare you get sick/go on vacation/neglect the newsgroup for your real life?
</ul>
</strong>
   Remaining calm in the face of this sort of criticism is the best
   defense.  If there are actual facts under the heated rhetoric,
   address those calmly and ignore the tone of the criticism.  Apart
   from that, your best defense is just to ignore the poster especially
   if the complainer seems to be the only one whining.  Resist the
   temptation to have the last word in an argument, even if the argument
   is in public.  Drawn out bickering will only serve to undermine
   respect for you and your role.
<p>
   It helps to have form letters to deal with some of these questions,
   particularly the first two. [See Appendix B.] Keep the charter of the
   newsgroup handy too.

<p> 
<hr>
<h2><a href="#17TOC" name="17.5">17.5. Anonymous postings</a></h2> 
<p> 
   On some newsgroups, the moderator will facilitate anonymous postings
   by stripping identifying headers from submissions, if so requested.
   On other newsgroups, the moderator requires that all submissions be
   from identified accounts, going so far as to reject all postings
   submitted through anonymous remailers.  In choosing your policy, you 
   should be aware that even 'identified' accounts may have very little 
   connection to a real person.  For all practical purposes, most user 
   accounts on large commercial network providers such as 
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065408/http://www.earthlink.com/">earthlink.com</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065408/http://www.aol.com/">aol.com</a> are anonymous - the user
   chooses what, if any, identifying information is visible.
<p>
   No matter what policy you choose for your newsgroup, it should be
   documented clearly in the group's periodic policy posting.  It might
   also be wise to let the group's readership decide the policy, by
   holding a vote.
