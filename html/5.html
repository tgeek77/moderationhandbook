<h2><a href="#5top" name="5">5. How the moderation process works technically</a></h2>
<p>
   This section contains technical information about the news mechanisms
   of concern to newsgroup moderators, including standard news headers,
   dealing with submissions, and generating special purpose headers to
   better serve your newsgroup.
<p>

   A moderated newsgroup is marked as such in the news transport
   software (most often with a  trailing "m" flag in the active file of
   news systems).  What this means is that articles must be approved
   before they are accepted in the group.  When an article is posted to
   a moderated group, the news transport software will mail the article
   to the moderator [<a href="#5.1">See Section 5.1 Mailpath Usage</a>] 
   for approval and actual injection into the news system.
<p>

   Once the moderator has received a submitted article in the incoming
   mailbox, (and if necessary has edited the article's content) the
   moderator needs to process the article's headers a bit before
   actually posting it to the group.  The descriptions below explain
   usage of the various headers.
<p>

   Technically, all that the moderator has to do is add an "Approved"
   header, and repost the article.  The only thing that differentiates
   an "approved" from a "non-approved" posting is the existence of the
   "Approved:" header.  The news transport will then accept it and
   transfer it to other machines.
<p>

   New moderators, especially those not familiar with news mechanisms,
   may need to refer back to the list of standard news headers 
   (<a href="#5.2">Section 5.2</a>) often as they familiarize themselves 
   with the moderation process.
<p>

<hr>
<h2><a href="#5.1top" name="5.1">5.1. Mailpath usage</a>
</h2>
<p>

   When a net.citizen posts a message to a moderated newsgroup, the news
   software looks up the moderator's submission address. The software
   then mails the unapproved article to the moderator for approval and
   injection into the news system.
<p>

   To make this work the mailpaths file is used on B News or C News
   systems.  INN uses the moderators file and the inn.conf file to
   provide the same functionality.
<p>

   The list of moderator addresses can change almost daily and trying to
   keep up with it can be a job in itself at times. For that reason the
   mailpaths file can be configured to send all unapproved submissions
   to moderated newsgroups to a site which has volunteered and been
   approved as a mail forwarder for Usenet moderators. In almost all
   cases it is best to configure news software to forward unapproved
   articles to one of the established mailpath forwarders.
<p>

   David Lawrence <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/mailto:tale@isc.org.net">&lt;tale@isc.org.net&gt;</a>; maintains the periodic posting

<p align="CENTER"><strong><a href="/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/faqs/mailpaths/part1/">"How to Construct the Mailpaths File"</a></strong></p>

   It describes the syntax of the contents of the file and how to
   construct it for your B News or C News system.  It also lists the
   sites that are maintaining a current listing of moderator addresses
   and are acting as mail forwarders for the Usenet moderator
   infrastructure.

<p>
   The article is periodically posted to the newsgroups <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.lists">news.lists</a>,
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.admin.misc">news.admin.misc</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.answers">news.answers</a>.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#5.2top" name="5.2">5.2. Standard News Header Usage</a></h2>
<p>
   Articles posted to moderated newsgroups, like all other news
   articles, must conform to the article specifications of the Usenet
   news system, as described in RFC 1036[1].  The list below explains
   the standard news headers as they pertain to moderating Usenet
   newsgroups, though if there is any doubt about the specifications of
   a particular header RFC 1036 should be consulted.  
   [<a href="#5.10">See Section 5.10</a> for more information on obtaining 
   <a href="/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc1036.html">RFC 1036</a> and other NetNews related
   RFCs and documents.]
<p>

   There is no preferred order of headers. Compliant software should
   accept the articles with the following headers in any order.
<p>

<hr>
<h2><a href="#5.2.1top" name="5.2.1">5.2.1. Approved: Line</a></h2>
<p>
   Any article posted to a moderated newsgroup must contain an Approved:
   line.  Always sign the approved line with your electronic address.
   The software won't care what is here, but in case something goes
   wrong, the community will know who approved the article.
<p>

   Some moderators sign the Approved: line with the moderator's
   submission address, so that any comments-to-the-moderator tend to get
   routed into the moderation mailbox.
<p>

   A sample Approved: line:

<p align="CENTER"><strong>Approved: kent@landfield.com (comp.sources.misc)</strong></p>
<p>

   If an article has been approved by the moderators of different
   moderated groups, the moderator with final approval should try to put
   the other moderators on the Approved: line as a way of documenting
   that it was approved to appear in multiple groups.

<p>
   A sample Approved: line marking approval in more than one group:

<p align="CENTER"><strong>Approved: kent@landfield.com, tale@isc.org</strong></p>

   While showing multiple approvals is not required, it is informative to
   the readership and common courtesy to the other moderator(s) to do
   so.
<p>

<strong>
NOTE: Beware of approving cross-posted articles.  Refer to "Section   
    5.2.8 Newsgroups: Line", "Section 8.5 Dealing with cross-posted 
    articles" and "Section 15.6. Cross-posting to other moderated   
    groups" for a discussion of the problems.
</strong>
<p>

<hr>
<h2><a href="#5.2.2top" name="5.2.2">5.2.2. Date: Line</a></h2>
<p>
   Strip the Date: header from submitted articles, or change it into
   something like X-Original-Date:.  Do not include an X-Original-Date:
   header without a good reason.  For example, an article might refer to
   "today's New York Times", or might mention software "uploaded to an
   FTP site today.  Proving your timeliness isn't a good reason unless,
   for some reason, it has been in question.
<p>
   The problem with keeping the original Date: header is that it might
   badly confuse the news posting software, or some latency could cause
   the article to be unnecessarily rejected at sites, especially when
   the date was completely wrong.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#5.2.3top" name="5.2.3">5.2.3. Distribution: Line</a></h2>
<p>

   The Distribution: header should be stripped from any submitted
   article.  You should try not to post things of a definite local
   nature to world-wide groups with the current state of network news
   propagation.
<p>

   Unfortunately, using the Distribution: header rarely produces the
   intended or desired results.  An article posted with a restrictive
   Distribution: header is almost certain to be propagated far beyond
   the intended area, and will be equally likely to miss some sites that
   would be interested in that region's news, and might even be
   physically located in the intended target zone.

<p>
   In addition, many articles are posted with "na" (North America) or
   "usa" (U.S.A.) distributions because of poorly-thought-out software
   defaults, rather than any conscious decision by the poster.  Many
   non-North-American readers are annoyed by this needless limitation on
   what news reaches them.

<p>
   In theory distributions work as intended, but in practice, due to
   lack of verification by posting agents, misconfigured news transport
   agents, wide-area sites which pick up all news regardless of
   distribution, and inadequate controls on the names of the
   distributions, they are relatively useless.

<h2><a href="#5.2.4top" name="5.2.4">5.2.4. Expires: Line</a></h2> 
<p> 
   Moderators should consider adding an Expires: header if the
   information being posted has a limited period of usefulness.  For
   example, a Call For Papers (CFP) posted to the group
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.announce.conferences">news.announce.conferences</a> might be valid only until a certain date.
   The Expires: header can then be set to expire the article the day
   after the deadline specified in the CFP.
<p> 

   Many sites with limited news retention times keep articles with
   explicit Expires: headers online longer than the default time period,
   so an Expires: header can help keep periodically posted information
   readily available to readers at all times.
<p> 

   Your use of the Expires: line should be documented in your group's
   periodic policy posting.
<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.2.5top" name="5.2.5">5.2.5. Followup-To: Line</a></h2> 
<p> 
   If you have a policy of directing all followups to the article
   submitter, or if the submitter requests it, use the header line

<p align="CENTER"><strong>Followup-To: poster</strong></p>

   The news reader software will then email followups to the address
   listed in the Reply-To:, and if non-existent, to the From: address.
<p>

   In some cases it might be appropriate to place the name of an
   unmoderated discussion group in this header.
<p>

   For example:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/file://comp.sys.amiga.announce/">Comp.sys.amiga.announce</a> does not carry any discussions.
   Articles there contain the line

<p align="CENTER"><strong>Followup-To: comp.sys.amiga.misc</strong></p> 

   With this header, when a reader with compliant news software tries to
   followup to an article appearing in the group, their article is
   actually redirected to the unmoderated discussion group
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:comp.sys.amiga.misc">comp.sys.amiga.misc</a>.
<p>

   The appropriate use and content of this header are very dependent on
   the community of readers that the newsgroup is serving.
<p>

   <strong>NOTE: It is never correct to put an actual email address in the
   Followup-To: line.</strong>

<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.2.6top" name="5.2.6">5.2.6. From: Line</a></h2> 
<p> 
   Postings to newsgroups should have a From: line that refers to the
   submitter, unless the posting is a digest, in which case the From:
   line should be that of the compiler of the digest.
<p> 
   Since most news readers display From: line information, it is
   appropriate to accurately depict who the article's content is "From",
   when possible.
<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.2.7top" name="5.2.7">5.2.7. Keywords: Line</a></h2> 
<p> 
   Keywords: lines should be included as received in the posted article.
   Some moderators may want to add a Keywords: line if it doesn't
   already exist. Some moderators have added "SPOILERS" to the Keywords:
   line in articles posted to movie or book discussion groups if the
   article gives away the ending.
<p> 

   Some moderators have a list of all of the keywords used in the group
   and adjust the Keywords: line as needed.  Limiting the set of
   keywords makes keyword searching a lot easier and avoids problems
   with synonyms and variant spellings.
<p> 

   Keywords: should augment rather than replace keyword usage on the
   Subject: line because, unfortunately, some news reader programs
   cannot use Keywords: to auto-select articles.
<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.2.8top" name="5.2.8">5.2.8. Newsgroups: Line</a></h2> 
<p> 

   If the moderator receives a request to cross-post an article to
   multiple groups, and the moderator has a policy of honoring cross-
   posting requests, the moderator should try to comply with the
   poster's specification if the other groups make sense and are not
   moderated.

<p> 
   If the submitter requests cross-posting to newsgroups that the
   moderator cannot post to, the submitter should be so notified, unless
   there is a clear policy statement covering this inability. For
   example, users at many sites cannot post or cross-post articles to
   any alt groups.

<p> 
   If one or more of the other requested groups are moderated, the
   moderator can either inform the submitter that the article is being
   cross-posted to only unmoderated newsgroups or coordinate with the
   moderator(s) of the other group(s).  Leave the final decision of what
   is relevant on other newsgroups with moderators for those newsgroups.

<p> 
   Due to the nature of existing news software, an article cross-posted
   by a moderator to multiple moderated newsgroups appears in all the
   specified moderated groups without requiring the further approval of
   the other moderator(s).  A posting of this type will probably
   surprise and may even anger the other moderator(s) if the article
   posted violates the charter of the other moderated newsgroup(s).

<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.2.9top" name="5.2.9">5.2.9. Path: Line</a></h2> 
<p> 
   The original Path: line should be removed and the news system should
   be allowed to generate a new one.  The purpose of the Path: line is
   to show the path that the article took since being injected into the
   news system.  Since the moderator is the one that actually injects an
   article into the news system, any previous Path: line should be
   discarded before the moderator posts the article.
<p> 

   Also insure your news transport software generates a non-replyable
   Path: line.  For example:

<p align="CENTER"><strong>Path: host!not-for-mail</strong></p>

   This allows it to be propagated back to the site it came from.  It
   also assures that mail from seriously broken news sites is not
   returned to you.
<p>

   New moderators shouldn't need to worry about this. If there is not a
   Path: line in an article, most news transport software generate one
   similar to that shown above.
<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.2.10top" name="5.2.10">5.2.10. References: Line</a></h2> 
<p> 

   The References: header is used by some threaded newsreaders to chain
   a set of articles together.  It allows a discussion thread or multi-
   part posting to be dealt with as a unit.  The second and and
   subsequent articles in a set should include a References: header.
<p> 

   News reader software needs to be able to reconstruct the article tree
   even if (a) the root article is missing, such as the article has
   expired, (b) the immediate predecessor is missing as in a canceled
   article.  The software must do this based solely on information from
   the References: headers of existing articles.
<p> 

   The References: headers are used in different ways today depending on
   the article flow in the moderated group.  If articles are posted so
   that all linked articles are posted in sequence and within a short
   period, such as is done in sources groups, then References: headers
   can be constructed with a minimalist method.  Otherwise, groups where
   referenced articles are not in sequence or are posted days apart
   should use the standard References: header usage.
<p> 

   The standard and recommended usage of the References: headers is to
   include the Message-ID of both the first and one to three immediately
   prior article(s), in chronological order. The reason for this
   strategy is to keep news reader programs with thread-specific kill
   files happy after some articles have expired.
<p> 

   With the minimalist method used by source or binary moderated
   newsgroups, the References: header contains the Message-ID of the
   first part of the series (or package).  The References: header only
   lists the Message-ID of the first part posted and not all the
   intermediate parts.
<p> 

   By using this header, threaded news readers present each set of
   postings as a single item to the user making it much easier for them
   to read.
<p> 

   <strong>NOTE:  Another way of linking articles is to list the Message-ID of
   every part. This is not recommended as it just increases the size of
   the articles without adding much additional information or utility.</strong>

<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.2.11top" name="5.2.11">5.2.11. Reply-To: Line</a></h2> 
<p> 
   The Reply-To: line should be preserved if it existed in the
   submission.  This allows the news reader software to email replies
   back to the article's submitter at their preferred address.

<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.2.12top" name="5.2.12">5.2.12. Subject: Line</a></h2> 
<p> 

   Standardizing your use of the Subject: line somewhat can really help
   readers choose which articles to read and construct accurate kill
   files.  A leading or trailing keyword system can help immensely, for
   example.   Moderators of source and binary newsgroups use the
   Subject: line in a de-facto way to make it easier for the readership
   to see what an article is.  For example:
<p>
<strong>
<ul>
      <lh>v43INF1:  Introduction to comp.sources.misc
      <br>v43i001:  ecuman - Manual for ECU comm package v3.30, Part01/06
      </lh>
</ul>
</strong>

<p>
   The leading volume-issue and the trailing Part number information are
   helpful in giving the readership quick clues to an article.
<p>

   Assure that your use of the Subject: line is documented in the
   newgroup's policy posting so that the readership knows it is
   occurring and can take advantage of it.

<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.2.13top" name="5.2.13">5.2.13. Other Informational headers</a></h2> 
<p> 
   There are additional headers that a submitter may supply from time to
   time.  Informational headers such as Summary: and Organization: lines
   should be included as received in the posted article.
<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.3top" name="5.3">5.3. Other headers that should be removed before posting</a></h2> 
<p> 
   Submitted articles may arrive in your mailbox with one or more
   headers that should be removed before posting.  Automated scripts can
   do this for you, or, for a low-volume group, you might prefer to
   remove them by hand, or write your own pre-processing tools.

<strong>
<ul>
                       <lh>NNTP-Posting-Host:

</ul>
</strong>
<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.4top" name="5.4">5.4. Signatures</a></h2> 
<p> 
   Some moderators allow all postings to go out with the original
   signature block as received.  Others trim excessive signature blocks
   off, or remove all but a few lines.  In other cases, the moderator
   will append a standard newsgroup signature to the bottom of the
   posting, typically containing a line or two describing how to submit
   articles to the newsgroup, how to retrieve the FAQ, or other highly
   condensed information.
<p> 

   Moderators need to be aware that news software may be appending the
   moderator's own personal signature file to the end of postings.  This
   may not be desired and can cause confusion with the original
   submitter's signature.  The moderator should decide what is the most
   appropriate way to deal with their personal signature.

<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.5top" name="5.5">5.5. Creating newsgroup specific headers</a></h2> 
<p> 
   A moderator may find that their newsgroup is better served with the
   addition of non-standard informational header lines to the individual
   postings.  This can be done with user-definable "X-" headers placed
   in the <a href="/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc1036.html">RFC 1036</a> header portion of the 
   article or by creating auxiliary headers as the 
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:comp.sources">comp.sources</a>.* groups have done.
<p> 

   Source newsgroup moderators have established additional headers whose
   sole purpose is to support the posting of source code, automatic
   archiving and index creation.
<p> 

   Auxiliary headers do not appear in the 
   <a href="/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc1036.html">RFC 1036</a> "News" header section
   of an article.  Instead they are the first lines of the article text
   separated from the news headers by a single line containing a
   newline.  The actual article text is then separated from the
   auxiliary headers by another single line containing a newline.
<p> 

   In either case, the moderator should inform the newsgroup of the
   purpose and use of the new headers.  This should be done in the
   periodic policy posting.

<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.6top" name="5.6">5.6. Receiving submissions</a></h2> 
<p> 
   Submissions are received by the moderator as mail.  Although it is
   possible to use a personal mailbox, it is not advisable.  The
   moderator mailbox should be either a separate account or an alias
   that points to the moderator's personal account. There are various
   reasons for doing this, among them:
<p> 
<ul>
      <li>Filtering on the To: line to separate submissions from other
          mail.
<p>
      <li>Ease of maintenance when the moderator moves or is replaced.
<p>
      <li>Most important, if it's the same mailbox is very hard to tell
          what's a submission from what's personal mail.
<p>
      <li>[Others, I am sure]
</ul>
<p>

   Submissions to a moderated group should be automatically acknowledged
   when received.  This can be accomplished using the deliver or
   procmail mail processing packages.  The UCB Vacation program can also
   be used to generate acknowledgements.
<p>

   Deliver is available from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:comp.sources.reviewed">comp.sources.reviewed</a> archives in volume1.
   Procmail is available from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:comp.sources.misc">comp.sources.misc</a> archives in volume43.
   Other mail filtering programs may be used as such as 'mh' and the
   'filter' program that comes as part of Elm.

<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.6.1top" name="5.6.1">5.6.1. Articles posted to a moderated group</a></h2> 
<p> 
   There are a couple ways that a reader can submit an article to be
   posted to a moderated newsgroup.  The reader can post the article to
   the moderated newsgroup as if the group was not moderated.  If the
   news software is properly configured then it will forward the article
   to the appropriate moderator for approval.  Unfortunately, it is not
   unusual for a posting to be lost in a misconfigured news system.
   Readers then send mail to the moderator wondering where their article
   went to.  The moderator has not seen it and has no idea what the
   submitter is talking about.
<p> 

   Other problems with encouraging direct posting to newsgroups is that
   the article might be cross-posted or might have been sent without
   knowing the group's moderation status.  Another problem that makes
   directly posted articles harder to deal with is the duplicate headers
   problem described in 
   <a href="/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod16.html#16.7">Section 16.7</a>.
<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.6.2top" name="5.6.2">5.6.2. Emailed submissions</a></h2> 
<p> 
   Moderators should consider encouraging submitters to mail articles to
   the submission address directly instead of direct postings to the
   group.  The benefits are, users are usually alerted to mail problems
   faster than news problems, duplicate headers are not a problem and
   articles received via email are guaranteed not to be cross-posted.
   All in all, emailed submissions tend to cause moderators less grief
   then do directly posted submissions.

<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.7top" name="5.7">5.7. Adding moderator comments</a></h2> 
<p> 
   Comments from the moderator, if necessary, should be added in a way
   that clearly differentiates the comments from the submitted article.
   This is usually done by including comments enclosed in brackets <strong>[
   such as this ]</strong>.  Whether the comments are included at the beginning
   or appended to the end of the article does not really matter.  It has
   been suggested that placing the comments at the end of a posting is
   better since it does not interrupt the flow of the author's train of
   thought.
<p>

   It is also sometimes appropriate to interject comments into the
   middle of a posted article; for example, if a post gives a vague
   reference to an FTP site, the moderator may wish to add a line with a
   specific reference immediately below that paragraph to avoid
   confusion.
<p>

   Also moderators should sign the comments, either with their name or
   some way to identify the moderator (e.g.,<em> -mod, -editor</em> or the
   moderator's initials).
<p>

   No matter what method is chosen, the moderator should be consistent
   so that the group's readership can easily locate and recognize the
   moderator's comments.

<p>
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#5.8top" name="5.8">5.8. Submitting articles</a></h2> 
<p> 
   The software and process a moderator uses to post to a newsgroup can
   be as simple as piping an article through a script from within the
   moderator's mailer which posts it.  It can be as full blown as a
   program that creates Auxiliary headers for a source submission and
   checks for all sorts of potential name conflict problems and common
   posting errors.
<p>

   The moderator should determine what is needed to make these tasks
   easier.  Taking the time to try to figure out actual posting
   procedures can potentially save time every day.
<p>

   Posting software is available on the 
   <a href="/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/moderators/">moderator tools archive</a>. From
   the simplest "submit" script to the complication of "postit", the
   archive has a wide range of posting tools that are there for others
   to grab and modify for their purposes.  [See

<h2><a href="#5.9top" name="5.9">5.9. Canceling articles</a></h2> 
<p> 
   From time to time you may need to cancel an article. It may be that
   you need to cancel an article with forged approval or an article that
   was posted in error.  Whatever the reason, know how to cancel an
   article so that when the need arises you are prepared to cancel it
   quickly and correctly.

   To cancel an article, create a cancel message and post it the very
   same way the article was originally posted.  The From: and Sender:
   headers need to be the same as they were in the original article.
   Take the Message-ID: of the article being canceled and make it the
   cancel header by "Control: cancel &lt;message-id&gt;".
<p>

   You should use the same Newsgroups: line as the original, and you
   must have an Approved: line, otherwise it'll get submitted to the
   moderator for approval.
<p>

   You might choose to make the Subject: contents the same, but it is
   not necessary.  Finally, if you provide your own Message-IDs for your
   articles make sure that you give the cancel message a new Message-ID.
   For example, to cancel this message:
<p>
<strong>
<ul>
         <lh>Newsgroups: your.newsgroup,other.newsgroup
         <br>From: I-made-a-mistake@erroneous.com (I. Goofed)
         <br>Sender: usenet@erroneous.com
         <br>Message-ID: &lt;12345abcde@erroneous.com&gt;
         <br>Subject: How to shoot yourself in the foot
         <br>Approved: &lt;your usual Approved: line&gt;
         </lh>
</ul>
</strong>
<p>
   Post this cancel message:
<p>
<strong>
<ul>
         <lh>Newsgroups: your.newsgroup,other.newsgroup
         <br>From: I-made-a-mistake@erroneous.com (I. Goofed)
         <br>Sender: usenet@erroneous.com
         <br>Control: cancel &lt;12345abcde@erroneous.com&gt;
         <br>Subject: Cancelling erroneous article
         <br>Message-ID: &lt;something.other.than.12345abcde@erroneous.com&gt;
         <br>Approved: &lt;your usual Approved: line&gt;
         </lh>
</ul>
</strong>
<p>
   Also put a note in the body of the cancellation message explaining
   why you cancelled the article.  This is normally just a one-line
   comment.

<p>
   There are scripts in the <a href="/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/moderators/">moderator tools archive</a>

   Henry Spencer has a draft of a successor to RFC 1036 that attempts to
   document and explain all subsequent enhancements and existing
   practice as implemented in the newer news systems.  This draft (often
   called son-of-1036) can be obtained by anonymous ftp from
   ftp.zoo.toronto.edu.  Son-of-1036 is intended to be stand-alone reading 
   and does not require that one also read RFCs 2822 or 1123.

   The IETF's Usenet Article Standard Update Working Group (usefor) is
   actively working to create an official update to RFC 1036. More
   information on the working group, as well as the group's archives are

   Chris Lewis maintains an FAQ that suggests a format for an FAQ.

   It is periodically posted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.admin.misc">news.admin.misc</a> and to the groups
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.software.readers">news.software.readers</a> and *.answers.

<p>
   It is also probably a wise thing to re-read the documents that are
   posted from time to time in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.announce.newusers">news.announce.newusers</a> so that you are
   aware of what the rest of the community is seeing.  It may have been
   a long time since you last read those articles and they have changed
   over the years.
