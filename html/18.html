<h2><a href="#18TOC" name="18">18. Answers to general questions</a></h2>
<p>
   The following section is a frequently asked questions list with
   answers.  They are listed in no particular order.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a href="#18TOC" name="18.1">18.1. How big is my group's readership ?</a></h2>
<p>
   Use to be the best way to determine readership was via the newsgroup
   reports that were posted monthly by Brian Reid &lt;reid@pa.dec.com&gt; to
   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065216/news:news.lists">news.lists</a>.  This is no longer supported.
   The real answer is <strong>"Guess"</strong>.
<p> 
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#18TOC" name="18.2">18.2. What mechanisms guard the group from unauthorized "Approved:" headers ?</a></h2> 
<p> 
   None.  The best process is for the moderator to read the group from
   another site and cancel anything posted to his/her group by
   'outsiders'.  (You should try to do it from another site, in general,
   because the type of person who posts their own stuff to a moderated
   group frequently puts your "official" site in the Path: line in an
   attempt to keep you from seeing the posting.)
<p> 
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#18TOC" name="18.2">18.3. Have any moderators gotten paid for what they do ?</a></h2> 
<p> 
   Yes.  Sometimes a moderator's employer understands the importance of
   news moderation, and the effort involved in doing a good job, and
   allows the employee to perform some moderation tasks during working
   hours, or on the employer's equipment.  This potentially gives the
   organization greater visibility through an Organization: header or
   signature file in the moderator's postings.  While the moderator is
   not being directly paid for moderation duties, their normal
   compensation covers time spent working on the newsgroup.
<p>
   The group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065216/news:comp.research.japan">comp.research.japan</a> received a grant from the U.S.  Office
   of Naval Research to help support the operation of the group.  There
   have been other research oriented groups that have received support,
   but to-date moderation is usually a volunteer position with no
   compensation other than a grateful community.
<p> 
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#18TOC" name="18.4">18.4. Why are readers complaining of lost articles ?</a></h2> 
<p> 
   A complaint a moderator hears from time to time concerns lost
   submissions. There are several reasons for these complaints.
<ul>
      <li>The reader is unaware of the group's moderated status
        <p>
        The reader replies to an article or submits a new one and
        does not see it appear within minutes in the newsgroup they
        are reading, as is the case for unmoderated newsgroups.
        <p>
        Solution: Advertise the moderation status in the newsgroup
                  in the group's periodic posting.
        <p>
        Solution: A somewhat more effective solution is to use a
                  moderated newsgroup .signature file.  That way,
                  new readers will be much more likely to see it than
                  even a weekly periodic posting.
        <p>
      <li>Reader turnaround expectation time
        <p>
        A reader may wish to see the article reviewed and posted
        even before the moderator gets to it.
        <p>
        Total Turnaround time, barring unusual network problems,
        may be calculated as follows:
        
<p align="CENTER"><strong>T = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4</strong></p>
        
        T1 == Time for the submission to the forwarding site for the 
        newsgroup from the site it is submitted [ 0.5 day ]
        <p>
        T2 == Time for the submission to be processed at the forwarding site 
        and transferred to moderator's email address [ 0.5 day ]
        <p>
        T3 == The suggested turnaround time by the moderator [ X days ]
        <p>
        T4 == Time a submission will take after posting at moderators site 
        to propagate to the authors [ 1 day ]
        <p>
        T = 2 days + X days.  For example: If a moderator has a turn
        around time of 1 day, it can take up to 3 days for an article
        to re-appear at the submitter's site.
        <p>
        Solution: Make the total expected turnaround time available.
                  Readers will know to wait before complaining their
                  articles are lost. Request they wait at least 'T'
                  time before flagging their articles as lost.
        <p>
      <li>Misconfigured local news software
        <p>
        Readers may complain that they are posting/sending articles
        which the moderators never see. None of the articles from that
        site ever reach the moderator(s). It is possible the site was
        configured correctly and in an update to the software something
        went wrong and articles no longer reach the moderators.
        <p>
        Solution: If all the previous options have been exhausted.
                  Ask them to pursue the following:
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Send a test submission. [if it fails continue on]
          <li>Talk to news@_user_site for an explanation.
          <li>Talk to usenet@_user_site if news@_user_site fails
              to reach a human being.
          <li>Talk to root@_user_site for mailer logs to check
              if the submissions are going out of the site.
          <li>In the meantime, request the reader to post through
              an alternate way by sending submissions to:
           <ul>
              <li>Mail2News gateways. e.g., group-name@cs.utexas.edu,
                   group-name-news@starbase.yale.edu

              <li>email submission directly to the moderator's
                   submission address
           </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>
        
      <li>Reader continue to complain
        <p>
        At this time, don't rule out the possibility of readers
        intentionally creating the problem make moderator(s) appear
        incompetent or to appear as 'victimized' by the moderators
        or any political agenda of their own.
        <p>
        It is recommended, moderators be upright and honest and inform
        the readership of what is being down to track the lost articles.
</ul>

<p> 
<hr> 
<h2><a href="#18TOC" name="18.5">18.5. Readers complain of articles being deleted after a day</a></h2> 
<p> 
   Every system that runs the news software has its own set of article
   expiration times set by its news administrator.  The admin sets the
   expiration period depending on how many groups they carry and how
   much disk space is available.  As a full news feed is over 100 MBytes
   a day and rising, some groups are set to expire very rapidly.  That
   is probably what is happening to the articles your users are worried
   about.  Most news admins expire articles faster in groups they think
   are less important, to make space for those they think really matter.
   For example, some sites keep alt. groups only 1-2 days but keep the
   comp.* groups much longer.
<p>
   Tell the readers having the problem to talk to their local news
   admins.  Most will extend the life of a particular group their users
   say they find important to them.
<p>
   There is a way that you can indicate that your articles should not be
   expired so quickly as the rest - the Expires: header.  However, this
   should not be used for normal articles as it is not reasonable to try
   to override the local news admin's policy on how to use the limited
   disk space on their systems.  If your group has an FAQ or other
   regular monthly information posting, though, you may like to use the
   Expires: header on that article - look in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065216/news:news.answers">news.answers</a> for lots of
   <a href="/web/20071021065216/http://www.landfield.com/faqs/">FAQ articles</a>, many of which will have an Expires:
<p>
   Note however that, partly because of misuse of the Expires: header in
   the past, some systems no longer support it and expire all articles
   at the same rate.  The only real way your users can be sure of
   keeping the articles long enough is for them to get the support of
   their local news admin.
