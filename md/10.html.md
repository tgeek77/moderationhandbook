#### NetNews Moderator\'s Handbook {#netnews-moderators-handbook align="CENTER"}

## [10. Multiple or Team Moderation](#10) {#multiple-or-team-moderation align="CENTER"}

[**Sections:**]{#10TOC}

[10.1. Team moderator mailing lists](#10.1)

[10.2. Facilitators](#10.2)

[10.3. Rejection Notices](#10.3)

[10.4. Multiple moderator conflict resolution](#10.4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [10. Multiple or Team Moderation](#10TOC){#10}

In some cases it might be possible to share a moderation job, rotating
from one person to another. No one moderator should become hard to
replace. In many cases, a diversity in moderation styles and filtering
choices will enrich a group.

If the topic of your group makes it possible for you to split the task
(by sub-topic or otherwise) consider it desirable to \"farm out\" the
work as it reduces moderator burn-out. As \'titles\' are an easy reward
to give, consider \'Guest Moderators\', \'Associate Moderators\' and
\'Co-Moderators\'.

For extremely high volume newsgroups it may be necessary to have the
group moderated by a team of moderators. Some such groups have as many
as 10 moderators. There are benefits for having a team of moderators,
including,

-   no need for backup moderators,
-   much easier to go on vacation or take a short break,
-   consulting/second opinion on topics of concern,
-   possible to have a moderator dedicated to answering queries.
-   more bodies working towards making the newsgroup a better resource,

There are different ways for a team of moderators to manage a
newsgroup\'s volume. STUMP (Secure Team-based USENET Moderation Program)
is a robomoderator allowing teams of moderators or individual moderators
to moderate a newsgroup, via email or Web interface. For more
information on STUMP, see

[http://www.algebra.com/\~ichudov/stump/](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065531/http://www.algebra.com/~ichudov/stump/)

Reguardless of the software used, there are things that any moderation
team should be aware of and need to do. Setting up the process and rules
of team moderation is critical to a successful group. Don\'t forget team
moderation is a real \"team\" effort.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [10.1. Team moderator mailing lists](#10TOC){#10.1}

Like any other moderated newsgroup, an alias for submissions to the
newsgroup should be setup. The incoming articles need to be distributed
among the moderators. There are software packages available in the
moderators archive which do this. Three strategies for submission
distribution among moderators are:

-   systematic distribution,
-   random distribution,
-   moderator selected message locking.

Systematic distribution usually targets the next moderator to receive a
submission in a round-robin fashion. \[See [Section 7.2. Email
submission
servers](/web/20071021065531/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod07.html#7.2)
for a description of random distribution.\] The \*.answers moderators
have set up a scheme whereby all incoming messages are entered into a
queue, and individual moderators lock messages to take them out of the
queue for servicing. This has the advantage that should an individual
moderator take a vacation, absolutely no reconfiguration needs to be
done.

Besides the normal submission and administrative list address it is
necessary to have a list address for the moderation team members. In a
team moderation scenario, it is recommended that moderators communicate
closely with each other to enforce a standard moderation policy and to
discuss matters relating to the newsgroup.

Any message sent to the team list goes to all the group moderators. It
is also helpful for any reader who may wish to pose a question or make a
comment to all the moderators.

A pointer to the team moderators list should be included in the group\'s
FAQ or the group\'s policy posting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [10.2. Facilitators](#10TOC){#10.2}

Someone needs to be responsible for maintaining the list of moderators
receiving the submissions. The moderator team list needs to be
frequently updated as moderators go on leave etc. This may be an
existing group moderator but it should more properly be a non- moderator
acting as a facilitator.

More successful team moderated groups have a group of people working
with the group moderators supplying unbiased services to the team. For
example, facilitators provide additional services to the group and the
moderation team by:

-   maintaining the distribution script,
-   writing and maintaining FAQs,
-   \'owners\' of moderation submission, administrative and team mailing
    list addresses/facilities,
-   maintaining the official group archives or WWW access,
-   supplying other group specific needs.

What facilitators are NOT expected to do is:

-   receive articles for the newsgroup,
-   review articles for the newsgroup,
-   post submitted articles to the newsgroup.

In times of group crisis, facilitators should have the right to post an
article using an \'Approved:\' line. It is expected that facilitators
would only post original articles explaining the situation or its
solution as absolutely necessary to resolve a moderator conflict.

Having a good communication among not only the moderators but also the
facilitators keeps the newsgroup functionality healthy. An example of
such a mailing list is: \'srg-admin\@aldhfn.org\' for the group
soc.religion.gnosis. Another example is \'ww2-mods\@acpub.duke.edu\'.

In this case, the mailing list for the moderators and facilitators is
the same one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [10.3. Rejection Notices](#10TOC){#10.3}

It is recommended that all rejection notices sent out, in multiple
moderators environment, be carbon copied to all the moderators and
facilitators. This helps in avoiding confusion & conflicts.

In general, all rejections should be honored by co-moderators, unless
majority moderators overturn it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [10.4. Multiple moderator conflict resolution](#10TOC){#10.4}

Sometimes conflicts between moderators can get out of hand and spill
over into the group. Then everyone suffers.

In extreme cases, with a polarized readership, it\'s generally better to
have all moderators resign and stand for re-election, or choose some
other way of letting the readership have its say, rather than relying
on, for example, confidence motions among the moderators.

In some cases, it makes sense to use a corporate board of directors
model for moderatorship, and document it officially.

This is something that needs to be decided early and not something to be
decided when the problem arises. It should be documented in the group\'s
policy posting at a minimum and really should be addressed in the
group\'s charter if possible.

Methods of handling inter-moderator conflicts need to be decided before
conflicts arise, especially in groups which handle a controversial or
emotional topic. Once a problem gets out of control, it can be difficult
to get people to agree on a method for resolving it. These methods
should be documented in the group\'s policy posting or available from
the official FTP site.
