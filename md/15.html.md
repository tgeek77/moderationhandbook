#### NetNews Moderator\'s Handbook {#netnews-moderators-handbook align="CENTER"}

15\. Tools for moderators

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An archive of tools written and used by moderators of Usenet newsgroups
now exists. In the past, most moderators were forced to write much of
their posting software by themselves, though sometimes other experienced
moderators would share their sources when asked. Until recently there
has not been a single archive where moderators could make what they had
available for all to use.

Moderators both new and existing can see how others with similar types
of newsgroups are doing their job. A much wider set of support software
is becoming available to the moderating community as we all bring our
tools out of the closet. There is no reason new moderators need to
develop their own software/support environment from scratch as has been
the norm in the past. To make the tools most useful, the moderator will
probably need to be familiar with the \'C\' language, UNIX shell and
perl scripts, in order to adapt them to their own group\'s needs.

The contents of the moderators\' tools archive have been generously made
available in an \"AS IS\" condition. The archive is a snapshot of
existing tools, as they are being used, rather than a formal release of
polished software. Many of the sources, scripts, and supporting
documentation are not as pretty as their authors might wish, but they
work. The tools are being made available so that other moderators can
see working examples of how the tasks are handled, and potentially use
them as a starting point for their own custom tools.

If you would like to contribute, either send your tools to

[mod-archive\@landfield.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065632/mailto:mod-archive@landfield.com)

or send email explaining where the tools can be picked up.

The moderator\'s tool archive is available via HTTP or FTP from

[http://www.landfield.com/moderators/](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065632/http://www.landfield.com/moderators/)\
or\
[ftp://ftp.landfield.com/moderators/](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065632/ftp://ftp.landfield.com/moderators/)

[UUNET](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065632/http://www.uu.net/)
mirrors the tools directory and has made it available via FTP from

[ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/news/moderating/](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065632/ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/news/moderating/)
