## [Appendix B: Canned Messages](#B) {#appendix-b-canned-messages align="CENTER"}

[**Sections:**]{#BTOC}

[B.1. C News Duplicate headers message template](#B.1)

[B.2. Thanks for FAQ comments](#B.2)

[B.3. Inappropriate submission](#B.3)

[B.4. Get a Clue](#B.4)

[B.5. Test elsewhere](#B.5)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Appendix B: Canned Messages](#BTOC){#B}

All moderators get a certain amount of wildly off-topic submissions, and
it helps to have a form letter that you can send to clueless folks,
without having to take the time to figure out why they might have been
posting to your group, or where they should have sent their post, or
whether it was their brain or their software that erred.

Here are a few types of canned responses that you may want to have handy
to save you time and effort:

-   Read the FAQ, where the question you asked is answered.
-   Your message wasn\'t posted because it was similar to several other
    messages just posted, but thanks anyway.
-   Your question was answered by past messages, here\'s how to look in
    the archives.
-   You have been taken off the mailing list \[if your group is two-way
    gatewayed to a BITNET list\] because mail to you bounced. If your
    mail now works go ahead and resubscribe.
-   To subscribe or unsubscribe to the mailing list, send a message to
    blah.
-   Your message was cross-posted to other moderated newsgroups and the
    policy of this newsgroup is no cross-posting. It appeared on this
    one but no others.
-   Various responses pointing people at on-line resources.

When a spamming message is received, just throw it away with no response
at all, particularly if it was cross-posted to a bunch of equally
irrelevant groups. There is no reason to alert the spammer to the fact
that the message wasn\'t posted. If it seems like it might be useful,
send a polite note to **usenet@** or the **postmaster@** the spammer\'s
site.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [B.1. C News Duplicate headers message template](#BTOC){#B.1}

Dear postmaster/usenet administrator:

I am the moderator of \<insert your group here>. I receive emailed
submissions for the group. As I get a lot of submissions, it can
sometimes be rather time consuming to get incoming articles ready for
posting. You appear to be running C News, which has the annoying habit
of inserting duplicate sets of headers when the transport software sends
the posting from your user to me. While a single posting like this
isn\'t a problem by itself, after the 100th or 1000th time it gets
rather tiresome, and it\'s \*very\* simple to fix.

Explanation: in C News, the newsbin/relay/injnews script is used by
inews to do site-specific header bashing. When it discovers that the
newsgroup is moderated, it invokes mail to send off the article to the
moderator (via mailpaths). Unlike B News and INN, where time has been
spent to configure how to use the mail transport directly (to merge the
news headers in with the mail headers), C News blindly punts the article
into \"mail\" which is a user agent, which often refuses to accept
\"header-like\" stuff at the beginning of a message as part of the RFC
822 header block. In essence, mail will often implicitly put a blank
line at the beginning of the message, so the headers carefully crafted
by injnews end up as part of the body instead of the mail headers.

The solution is simple - change injnews to call the mailer (usually the
transport) in such a way that injnews\' headers are included in the mail
headers. In relaynews/injnews, there is the following line:

mail \"\$moderator\" \<\$censart

Change it to call the mail transport directly. If you\'re using sendmail
or smail, simply change \"mail\" to be the full path. Eg:

/usr/lib/sendmail \"\$moderator\" \<\$censart

Most other transports, such as MMDF or PP should be just as simple.
Please note that injnews is intended to be modified for local site
policy, so you won\'t be voiding your warranty ;-)

If you\'re not using sendmail or smail, or simply wish to test this, try
typing:

\<your mail transport program \<your address> Subject: it worked

hello

It should appear in your mailbox with Subject: properly recognized. If
the subject isn\'t recognized, then it didn\'t work, and \"Subject: it
worked\" will appear in the body.

If you have any questions, please don\'t hesitate to contact me. Thank
you for your time,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [B.2. Thanks for FAQ comments](#BTOC){#B.2}

Thank you for your comments on the \<FAQ title here> FAQ. I\'m updating
the FAQ now, and am including your corrections or additions as
appropriate. Expect to see them in the next posting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [B.3. Inappropriate submission](#BTOC){#B.3}

*(Begin form letter.)*

The message below was submitted by you to the moderator of \<newsgroup>
either by posting a message to the group, or by sending E-mail to the

## [B.4. Get a Clue](#BTOC){#B.4}

*(Begin form letter.)*

The message below was submitted by you to the moderator of \<newsgroup>
either by posting a message to the group, or by sending E-mail to the
group\'s submission address, or by sending mail to the group\'s
administrative address.

Your message is not appropriate for posting to \<newsgroup>.

\<Description of your newsgroup here>

Unfortunately, I do not have the time to make specific suggestions as to
where your question or post should go but some ideas are included below.

If you are new to Usenet, you should probably read the posts in
[news.announce.newusers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:news.announce.newusers)
(n.a.n.) \-- if they are not available in your newsreader, they also
available by anonymous FTP in
[rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.announce.newusers/](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/file://rtfm.mit.edu//pub/usenet/news.announce.newusers/)\*

A few that are most likely to be immediately helpful are:

-   [A_Primer_on_How_to_Work_With_the_Usenet_Community](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/primer/part1/)
-   [Answers_to_Frequently_Asked_Questions_about_Usenet](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/faq/part1/preamble.html)
-   [Emily_Postnews_Answers_Your_Questions_on_Netiquette](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/emily-postnews/part1/)
-   [Hints_on_writing_style_for_Usenet](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/writing-style/part1/)
-   [Introduction_to_the\_\*.answers_newsgroups](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/news-answers/introduction/preamble.html)
-   [Rules_for_posting_to_Usenet](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/posting-rules/part1/)
-   [What_is_Usenet?](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/what-is/part1/)

To find what groups are relevant for your question, you might scan
through your local list of newsgroups (your .newsrc file on most Unix
systems), to see which group names seem related. Then subscribe to those
groups, and look at some of the recent traffic, to make sure that your
question is suitable for the group. (For example, questions about
Microsoft Windows belong in
[comp.os.ms-windows](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:comp.os.ms-windows).\*,
not
[comp.windows](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:comp.windows).\*)

On some systems, you will be able to look at a file containing a
one-line description of the purpose of each newsgroup (the
\'newsgroups\' file), or at a longer description of the purpose and
contents of each newsgroup (the newsgroup charters.) Ask your local news
administrator if these resources are available on your system.

For widely-distributed newsgroups, you can also find the one-line
descriptions in the following n.a.n postings:

-   [List of Active Newsgroups, Part
    I](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/active-newsgroups/part1/)
-   [List of Active Newsgroups, Part
    II](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/active-newsgroups/part2/)
-   [Alternative Newsgroup Hierarchies, Part
    1](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-hierarchies/part1/)
-   [Alternative Newsgroup Hierarchies, Part
    2](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-hierarchies/part2/)
-   [Alternative Newsgroup Hierarchies, Part
    3](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-hierarchies/part3/)
-   [Alternative Newsgroup Hierarchies, Part
    4](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-hierarchies/part4/)

The \'List\' posts describe newsgroups in the comp, misc, news, rec,
soc, sci, and talk hierarchies. The \'Alt\' posts describe newsgroups in
the alt, bionet, bit, biz, clarinet, gnu, hepnet, ieee, inet, info, k12,
relcom, u3b, and vmsnet hierarchies. They will not describe groups that
are available only in your region or institution.

If these sources of information do not suggest some newsgroups which
might be appropriate for your questions, you may wish to post on the
newsgroup
[news.groups.questions](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:news.groups.questions),
whose charter includes helping users find newsgroups appropriate for
their questions. Please consult the above-listed sources before posting
on
[news.groups.questions](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:news.groups.questions),
however.

Very few sites carry all available newsgroups. Your local newsadmin can
help you access newsgroups that are not currently available, or explain
why certain groups are not available at your site. If your site does not
carry the newsgroup(s) where your post belongs, do NOT post it in other,
inappropriate groups.

Think very carefully before cross-posting to more than one, or perhaps
two, newsgroups. It is considered highly inappropriate to broadcast your
message to a wide selection of newsgroups merely to have more people
read it. Follow the general rules of Netiquette (Usenet etiquette)
described in the
[news.announce.newusers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:news.announce.newusers)
postings above.

Once you decide what newsgroup(s) are relevant to your question, make
sure that you\'re not asking questions that are frequently asked and
answered. In addition to looking at recent traffic in the group, check
whether your question is included in an FAQ (Frequently Asked/Answered
Questions) list. Most FAQs are archived at
[rtfm.mit.edu](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/),
in directory /pub/usenet/your.group.name, if they\'re not available in
your newsreader in the specific group or in \*.answers. Many groups also
have a periodic introductory post that describes the content and purpose
of the newsgroup - if one exists, you should read it before posting.

A listing of many of the periodical postings on Usenet can be found in
n.a.n. or its archives, as

[List of Periodic Informational Postings, Part
\[1-20\]](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/periodic-postings/)

Following these suggestions will help not only to ensure that your post
reaches its intended audience, but to make Usenet more useful for all of
us.

## [B.5. Test elsewhere](#BTOC){#B.5}

*(Begin form letter.)*

The message below was submitted by you to the moderator of \<newsgroup>
either by posting a message to the group, or by sending E-mail to the
group\'s submission address, or by sending mail to the group\'s
administrative address.

The \<newsgroup> is not an appropriate place to send test messages. If
you wish to post a test message, there are newsgroups for that purpose,
such as
[alt.test](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:alt.test),
[misc.test](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:misc.test),
and
[news.test](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:news.test).
Messages sent to the \*.test newsgroups are automatically acknowledged
by daemons running at many sites. If you want to test your site set up
for posting to a moderated group, post your test message to the group
[misc.test.moderated](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025533/news:misc.test.moderated).

(End form letter.)
