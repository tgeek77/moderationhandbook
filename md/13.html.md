## [13. Creating Periodic Informational Postings](#13TOC){#13}

One of the best ways to communicate with your readership, as well as a
tool for saving you time, is via a policy posting, and potentially
additional [Frequently Asked Questions postings
(FAQ)](/web/20071021065305/http://www.landfield.com/faqs/).

A policy posting is an article that describes how you will run the
newsgroup. It should include information describing the use of any
additional Auxiliary header lines, how and where articles should be
submitted, and general guidelines for the group (often including the
charter) used by you in performing the responsibilities as the
newsgroup\'s moderator.

Other things that might be included are:

-   How you will deal with cross-posted submissions,
-   How postings of a commercial nature will be dealt with,
-   Use of backup or multiple moderators,
-   Items concerning the group that have been hashed out via the group
    or moderator lead surveys,
-   Where to obtain a current copy of the informational postings outside
    of the newsgroup. If possible, an email location or mailserver
    should be included, since not all users have FTP capabilities,
-   A list of sites, if any, that archive the group as well as how to
    become an archive site,
-   Moderator conflict resolution methods,
-   Moderator replacement policy.

This posting should be made periodically to the group.

Your group may be best served by having both a periodic policy posting
and an FAQ. Quite often it becomes necessary to have a Frequently Asked
Questions posting. Readers drop in and out of newsgroups frequently, and
may not be familiar with previous discussions. A FAQ posting can help
reduce the number of duplicate questions submitted to the newsgroup.

FAQ posting(s) do not have to be written, or even directly posted, by
the primary moderator. Many moderated groups have a group of relevant
FAQs posted, written by a number of authors. It is perfectly acceptable
to simply give an FAQ author permission to post or cross-post the FAQ
into your newsgroup. All the poster needs to do is add the appropriate
Approved: header to the FAQ posting. (Of course, if the moderator gives
others permission to post to the group, automatic cancellation software,
if used, should not cancel those articles.)

More suggestions about writing and maintaining FAQs, as well as
information about automatic FAQ-posting software, can be gotten from the
**faq-maintainers\@faqs.org** mailing list. To subscribe, send a message
to

[faq-maintainers-request\@faqs.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/mailto:faq-maintainers-request@faqs.org)

There is a good deal of information about writing FAQs and the FAQ
posting process available from

[http://www.faqs.org/authors.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/http://www.faqs.org/authors.html)

Having these types of documents as a consistent part of the group will
save you from answering the same questions again and again. The
readership will be able to get the majority of the information about the
group from the group itself. When people submit requests for information
that has already been covered, it is easy to simply forward the
appropriate informational posting to them, or send them a pointer to it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [13.1. Copyright](#13TOC){#13.1}

Recently there has been a lot of discussion about implicit and explicit
copyrights on policy and FAQ postings. This has become an issue, in
part, due to the increasing number of CD-ROM vendors and Internet How-To
book authors, who reproduce informational postings in commercial
products, with or without obtaining the permission of the authors or
maintainers.

It is wise to document your copyright and any distribution restrictions
within your periodic postings. In most cases you should try to be as
open as possible. The purpose of the newsgroups is to communicate
information to the community at large. Your information is probably
archived and available in many ways and places that you are not aware
of; it does not make a lot of sense to be overly sensitive to one
particular use of postings that have already been broadcast freely all
over the world. Remember that copyright laws can vary widely among the
many countries where your posting goes.

If asked, it is up to you if you want to see your group\'s informational
postings included. A suggestion might be to send a message back such as:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***I give you permission to use my FAQ for the group \'your.group\' as
you have requested with the following additional conditions:***

1.  You state explicitly that the information in the FAQ may not be
    entirely correct or up to date. That information should not be used
    directly without first checking it out. FAQ information is only a
    guideline.
2.  Do not change the content of the FAQ in any way but may reformat it
    to better integrate with your production media.
3.  Assure that credit is given as appropriate.
4.  You send me a free copy of the {book/cdrom\...}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is just a suggested starting point; feel free to modify it as
needed to suit your policies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [13.2. Frequency of distribution and news.answers](#13TOC){#13.2}

You will need to determine how often your informational postings are
actually posted to your group. Sources groups post them at the beginning
of each new volume in the archives. Discussion and announcement group
moderators may decide to post them on a periodic basis, usually once a
month. The policy statement should document how often informational
posting are done. If there are many requests for the FAQ, or repeats of
FAQ information, it may make sense to post the FAQ more often, or to
frequently post an explanation of how to obtain the FAQ or policy
posting.

It is strongly suggested that your policy posting and any FAQ have a
consistent Subject: line every time that it is posted, to assist readers
in recognizing it.

You may also want to consider cross-posting your informational postings
to
[news.answers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/news:news.answers)
and the other appropriate \*.answers newsgroups. This requires the prior
approval of the \*.answers moderators. The process is fairly easy, and
is described in the posting

[Introduction to the \*.answers
Newsgroups](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/news-answers/introduction/preamble.html)

and the other \*.answers groups, and

posted regularly to all of the \*.answers groups (

and

Additionally, they can be found archived at

[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/news.answers/](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/news-answers/)

The basic requirements for cross-posting to \*.answers, above basic
compliance with RFC 1036, are meeting the \*.answers standards for the
consistent content of a few of the standard header lines, and the
addition of an auxiliary header containing an Archive-name: header.
There are no format restrictions whatsoever on the contents of postings
to \*.answers.

The \*.answers groups are archived on
[rtfm.mit.edu](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/)
and elsewhere around the world such as on
[www.faqs.org/faqs/](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/).
If you are not sure if your consistent content of a few of the standard
header lines, and the addition of an auxiliary header containing an
Archive-name: header. There are no format restrictions whatsoever on the
contents of postings to \*.answers.

Even if you do not want to cross-post your informational posting to
\*.answers, you should have it listed in the

[\"List Of Periodic Informational
Posts\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/periodic-postings/)

which is posted regularly to
[news.lists](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/news:news.lists)
and
[news.answers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/news:news.answers).
To have your informational posting listed, send it to

[news-answers-request\@mit.edu](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065305/mailto:news-answers-request@mit.edu),

with a note saying what the posting frequency is, and that you wish to
add your posting to the List of Periodic Informational Posts, but are
not seeking approval for cross-posting to \*.answers.
