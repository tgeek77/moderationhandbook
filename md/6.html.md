#### NetNews Moderator\'s Handbook {#netnews-moderators-handbook align="CENTER"}

## [6. What are the different types of moderated groups ?](#6) {#what-are-the-different-types-of-moderated-groups align="CENTER"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Sections:**]{#6TOC}

[6.1. Announce groups](#6.1)

[6.2. Binary groups](#6.2)

[6.3. Digests](#6.3)

[6.4. Discussion groups](#6.4)

[6.5. Source groups](#6.5)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [6. What are the different types of moderated groups ?](#6TOC){#6}

Moderated groups come in many forms. A brief description of the major
types follows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [6.1. Announce groups](#6TOC){#6.1}

Announce groups are generally specified as low-volume newsgroups that
all readers interested in a specific topic may subscribe to. Some
announce groups serve as a collecting point for
[FAQs](/web/20071021065229/http://www.landfield.com/faqs/) and
announcements for a set of related newsgroups, such as
[rec.music.info](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065229/news:rec.music.info).
Most announce groups are chartered for fast turnaround time, which in
turn implies only light editing of content;
[comp.newprod](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065229/news:comp.newprod)
is a rare exception. Moderators of announce groups should make the
charter as specific as possible, and should keep the focus on the value
to the readers rather than the posters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [6.2. Binary groups](#6TOC){#6.2}

Binary groups exist to distribute software. \[See also Source groups,
[Section 6.5](#6.5)\] Binary groups distribute executable binaries or
other non-human-readable material, usually for one particular system
type. Normally binaries are distributed only for systems where many
users do not have development or compilation facilities, such as
personal computers of various types.

Moderators of binary groups should take particular care to prevent the
distribution of software containing viruses. Because UNIX executables
tend to rely on the site-specific configuration, they should never be
posted to the net.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [6.3. Digests](#6TOC){#6.3}

In preparing a digest, the moderator packs all accepted articles into
one file, and posts it to the newsgroup. Articles are edited to remove
unuseful mail headers, excessive signatures, and other noise. A summary,
table of contents, or other index information is added to the top of the
digest to assist readers in finding pertinent information. Depending on
the nature or volume of the group, digests may be sent out once a day,
or whenever a certain volume of messages has accumulated. Special-topic
digests may also be put out when one topic generates a large number of
messages.

The return address on a digest is the posting address for the group;
unless specified otherwise, all replies to the digest are considered
submissions. Digest format makes it difficult for readers to mail
replies to the authors of individual submissions, and defeats threaded
news readers; it is discouraged for these reasons. It is easy to send
news as separate items to the newsgroup while sending digests to mail
subscribers, as the Telecom digest does.

[RFC
1153](/web/20071021065229/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc1153.html)
specifies the digest format used by some moderated groups. \[See the
group
[comp.risks](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065229/news:comp.risks)
for an example.\] The \"MH\" mail package also supports building message
digests.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [6.4. Discussion groups](#6TOC){#6.4}

Discussion groups are usually moderated to quell overheated arguments or
to eliminate certain types of repetitive discussions. Moderation also
removes thoroughly inappropriate posts, such as chain letters, blanket
cross-posts, and topics specifically excluded from the group\'s charter.

Discussion groups are frequently used for questions, and moderators may
want to prepare a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) posting for the
group, or to delegate another knowledgeable poster to do so. Moderators
of discussion groups should also be prepared to answer common questions
offline, perhaps by forwarding the relevant section(s) of the FAQ.\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [6.5. Source groups](#6TOC){#6.5}

Source newsgroups are moderated newsgroups whose sole purpose is for the
distribution and archiving of source code. These groups are different
from the binary groups in that the distributed code is not compiled and
is in text format. The people receiving code from these groups are
expected to have the facilities to compile the programs into executable
form.
