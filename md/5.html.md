## [5. How the moderation process works technically](#5top){#5}

This section contains technical information about the news mechanisms of
concern to newsgroup moderators, including standard news headers,
dealing with submissions, and generating special purpose headers to
better serve your newsgroup.

A moderated newsgroup is marked as such in the news transport software
(most often with a trailing \"m\" flag in the active file of news
systems). What this means is that articles must be approved before they
are accepted in the group. When an article is posted to a moderated
group, the news transport software will mail the article to the
moderator \[[See Section 5.1 Mailpath Usage](#5.1)\] for approval and
actual injection into the news system.

Once the moderator has received a submitted article in the incoming
mailbox, (and if necessary has edited the article\'s content) the
moderator needs to process the article\'s headers a bit before actually
posting it to the group. The descriptions below explain usage of the
various headers.

Technically, all that the moderator has to do is add an \"Approved\"
header, and repost the article. The only thing that differentiates an
\"approved\" from a \"non-approved\" posting is the existence of the
\"Approved:\" header. The news transport will then accept it and
transfer it to other machines.

New moderators, especially those not familiar with news mechanisms, may
need to refer back to the list of standard news headers ([Section
5.2](#5.2)) often as they familiarize themselves with the moderation
process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.1. Mailpath usage](#5.1top){#5.1}

When a net.citizen posts a message to a moderated newsgroup, the news
software looks up the moderator\'s submission address. The software then
mails the unapproved article to the moderator for approval and injection
into the news system.

To make this work the mailpaths file is used on B News or C News
systems. INN uses the moderators file and the inn.conf file to provide
the same functionality.

The list of moderator addresses can change almost daily and trying to
keep up with it can be a job in itself at times. For that reason the
mailpaths file can be configured to send all unapproved submissions to
moderated newsgroups to a site which has volunteered and been approved
as a mail forwarder for Usenet moderators. In almost all cases it is
best to configure news software to forward unapproved articles to one of
the established mailpath forwarders.

David Lawrence
[\<tale\@isc.org.net>](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/mailto:tale@isc.org.net);
maintains the periodic posting

**[\"How to Construct the Mailpaths
File\"](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/faqs/mailpaths/part1/)**

It describes the syntax of the contents of the file and how to construct
it for your B News or C News system. It also lists the sites that are
maintaining a current listing of moderator addresses and are acting as
mail forwarders for the Usenet moderator infrastructure.

The article is periodically posted to the newsgroups
[news.lists](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.lists),
[news.admin.misc](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.admin.misc)
and
[news.answers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.answers).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2. Standard News Header Usage](#5.2top){#5.2}

Articles posted to moderated newsgroups, like all other news articles,
must conform to the article specifications of the Usenet news system, as
described in RFC 1036\[1\]. The list below explains the standard news
headers as they pertain to moderating Usenet newsgroups, though if there
is any doubt about the specifications of a particular header RFC 1036
should be consulted. \[[See Section 5.10](#5.10) for more information on
obtaining [RFC
1036](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc1036.html)
and other NetNews related RFCs and documents.\]

There is no preferred order of headers. Compliant software should accept
the articles with the following headers in any order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.1. Approved: Line](#5.2.1top){#5.2.1}

Any article posted to a moderated newsgroup must contain an Approved:
line. Always sign the approved line with your electronic address. The
software won\'t care what is here, but in case something goes wrong, the
community will know who approved the article.

Some moderators sign the Approved: line with the moderator\'s submission
address, so that any comments-to-the-moderator tend to get routed into
the moderation mailbox.

A sample Approved: line:

**Approved: kent\@landfield.com (comp.sources.misc)**

If an article has been approved by the moderators of different moderated
groups, the moderator with final approval should try to put the other
moderators on the Approved: line as a way of documenting that it was
approved to appear in multiple groups.

A sample Approved: line marking approval in more than one group:

**Approved: kent\@landfield.com, tale\@isc.org**

While showing multiple approvals is not required, it is informative to
the readership and common courtesy to the other moderator(s) to do so.

**NOTE: Beware of approving cross-posted articles. Refer to \"Section
5.2.8 Newsgroups: Line\", \"Section 8.5 Dealing with cross-posted
articles\" and \"Section 15.6. Cross-posting to other moderated groups\"
for a discussion of the problems.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.2. Date: Line](#5.2.2top){#5.2.2}

Strip the Date: header from submitted articles, or change it into
something like X-Original-Date:. Do not include an X-Original-Date:
header without a good reason. For example, an article might refer to
\"today\'s New York Times\", or might mention software \"uploaded to an
FTP site today. Proving your timeliness isn\'t a good reason unless, for
some reason, it has been in question.

The problem with keeping the original Date: header is that it might
badly confuse the news posting software, or some latency could cause the
article to be unnecessarily rejected at sites, especially when the date
was completely wrong.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.3. Distribution: Line](#5.2.3top){#5.2.3}

The Distribution: header should be stripped from any submitted article.
You should try not to post things of a definite local nature to
world-wide groups with the current state of network news propagation.

Unfortunately, using the Distribution: header rarely produces the
intended or desired results. An article posted with a restrictive
Distribution: header is almost certain to be propagated far beyond the
intended area, and will be equally likely to miss some sites that would
be interested in that region\'s news, and might even be physically
located in the intended target zone.

In addition, many articles are posted with \"na\" (North America) or
\"usa\" (U.S.A.) distributions because of poorly-thought-out software
defaults, rather than any conscious decision by the poster. Many
non-North-American readers are annoyed by this needless limitation on
what news reaches them.

In theory distributions work as intended, but in practice, due to lack
of verification by posting agents, misconfigured news transport agents,
wide-area sites which pick up all news regardless of distribution, and
inadequate controls on the names of the distributions, they are
relatively useless.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.4. Expires: Line](#5.2.4top){#5.2.4}

Moderators should consider adding an Expires: header if the information
being posted has a limited period of usefulness. For example, a Call For
Papers (CFP) posted to the group
[news.announce.conferences](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.announce.conferences)
might be valid only until a certain date. The Expires: header can then
be set to expire the article the day after the deadline specified in the
CFP.

Many sites with limited news retention times keep articles with explicit
Expires: headers online longer than the default time period, so an
Expires: header can help keep periodically posted information readily
available to readers at all times.

Your use of the Expires: line should be documented in your group\'s
periodic policy posting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.5. Followup-To: Line](#5.2.5top){#5.2.5}

If you have a policy of directing all followups to the article
submitter, or if the submitter requests it, use the header line

**Followup-To: poster**

The news reader software will then email followups to the address listed
in the Reply-To:, and if non-existent, to the From: address.

In some cases it might be appropriate to place the name of an
unmoderated discussion group in this header.

For example:
[Comp.sys.amiga.announce](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/file://comp.sys.amiga.announce/)
does not carry any discussions. Articles there contain the line

**Followup-To: comp.sys.amiga.misc**

With this header, when a reader with compliant news software tries to
followup to an article appearing in the group, their article is actually
redirected to the unmoderated discussion group
[comp.sys.amiga.misc](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:comp.sys.amiga.misc).

The appropriate use and content of this header are very dependent on the
community of readers that the newsgroup is serving.

**NOTE: It is never correct to put an actual email address in the
Followup-To: line.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.6. From: Line](#5.2.6top){#5.2.6}

Postings to newsgroups should have a From: line that refers to the
submitter, unless the posting is a digest, in which case the From: line
should be that of the compiler of the digest.

Since most news readers display From: line information, it is
appropriate to accurately depict who the article\'s content is \"From\",
when possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.7. Keywords: Line](#5.2.7top){#5.2.7}

Keywords: lines should be included as received in the posted article.
Some moderators may want to add a Keywords: line if it doesn\'t already
exist. Some moderators have added \"SPOILERS\" to the Keywords: line in
articles posted to movie or book discussion groups if the article gives
away the ending.

Some moderators have a list of all of the keywords used in the group and
adjust the Keywords: line as needed. Limiting the set of keywords makes
keyword searching a lot easier and avoids problems with synonyms and
variant spellings.

Keywords: should augment rather than replace keyword usage on the
Subject: line because, unfortunately, some news reader programs cannot
use Keywords: to auto-select articles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.8. Newsgroups: Line](#5.2.8top){#5.2.8}

If the moderator receives a request to cross-post an article to multiple
groups, and the moderator has a policy of honoring cross- posting
requests, the moderator should try to comply with the poster\'s
specification if the other groups make sense and are not moderated.

If the submitter requests cross-posting to newsgroups that the moderator
cannot post to, the submitter should be so notified, unless there is a
clear policy statement covering this inability. For example, users at
many sites cannot post or cross-post articles to any alt groups.

If one or more of the other requested groups are moderated, the
moderator can either inform the submitter that the article is being
cross-posted to only unmoderated newsgroups or coordinate with the
moderator(s) of the other group(s). Leave the final decision of what is
relevant on other newsgroups with moderators for those newsgroups.

Due to the nature of existing news software, an article cross-posted by
a moderator to multiple moderated newsgroups appears in all the
specified moderated groups without requiring the further approval of the
other moderator(s). A posting of this type will probably surprise and
may even anger the other moderator(s) if the article posted violates the
charter of the other moderated newsgroup(s).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.9. Path: Line](#5.2.9top){#5.2.9}

The original Path: line should be removed and the news system should be
allowed to generate a new one. The purpose of the Path: line is to show
the path that the article took since being injected into the news
system. Since the moderator is the one that actually injects an article
into the news system, any previous Path: line should be discarded before
the moderator posts the article.

Also insure your news transport software generates a non-replyable Path:
line. For example:

**Path: host!not-for-mail**

This allows it to be propagated back to the site it came from. It also
assures that mail from seriously broken news sites is not returned to
you.

New moderators shouldn\'t need to worry about this. If there is not a
Path: line in an article, most news transport software generate one
similar to that shown above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.10. References: Line](#5.2.10top){#5.2.10}

The References: header is used by some threaded newsreaders to chain a
set of articles together. It allows a discussion thread or multi- part
posting to be dealt with as a unit. The second and and subsequent
articles in a set should include a References: header.

News reader software needs to be able to reconstruct the article tree
even if (a) the root article is missing, such as the article has
expired, (b) the immediate predecessor is missing as in a canceled
article. The software must do this based solely on information from the
References: headers of existing articles.

The References: headers are used in different ways today depending on
the article flow in the moderated group. If articles are posted so that
all linked articles are posted in sequence and within a short period,
such as is done in sources groups, then References: headers can be
constructed with a minimalist method. Otherwise, groups where referenced
articles are not in sequence or are posted days apart should use the
standard References: header usage.

The standard and recommended usage of the References: headers is to
include the Message-ID of both the first and one to three immediately
prior article(s), in chronological order. The reason for this strategy
is to keep news reader programs with thread-specific kill files happy
after some articles have expired.

With the minimalist method used by source or binary moderated
newsgroups, the References: header contains the Message-ID of the first
part of the series (or package). The References: header only lists the
Message-ID of the first part posted and not all the intermediate parts.

By using this header, threaded news readers present each set of postings
as a single item to the user making it much easier for them to read.

**NOTE: Another way of linking articles is to list the Message-ID of
every part. This is not recommended as it just increases the size of the
articles without adding much additional information or utility.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.11. Reply-To: Line](#5.2.11top){#5.2.11}

The Reply-To: line should be preserved if it existed in the submission.
This allows the news reader software to email replies back to the
article\'s submitter at their preferred address.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.12. Subject: Line](#5.2.12top){#5.2.12}

Standardizing your use of the Subject: line somewhat can really help
readers choose which articles to read and construct accurate kill files.
A leading or trailing keyword system can help immensely, for example.
Moderators of source and binary newsgroups use the Subject: line in a
de-facto way to make it easier for the readership to see what an article
is. For example:

The leading volume-issue and the trailing Part number information are
helpful in giving the readership quick clues to an article.

Assure that your use of the Subject: line is documented in the
newgroup\'s policy posting so that the readership knows it is occurring
and can take advantage of it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.2.13. Other Informational headers](#5.2.13top){#5.2.13}

There are additional headers that a submitter may supply from time to
time. Informational headers such as Summary: and Organization: lines
should be included as received in the posted article.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.3. Other headers that should be removed before posting](#5.3top){#5.3}

Submitted articles may arrive in your mailbox with one or more headers
that should be removed before posting. Automated scripts can do this for
you, or, for a low-volume group, you might prefer to remove them by
hand, or write your own pre-processing tools.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.4. Signatures](#5.4top){#5.4}

Some moderators allow all postings to go out with the original signature
block as received. Others trim excessive signature blocks off, or remove
all but a few lines. In other cases, the moderator will append a
standard newsgroup signature to the bottom of the posting, typically
containing a line or two describing how to submit articles to the
newsgroup, how to retrieve the FAQ, or other highly condensed
information.

Moderators need to be aware that news software may be appending the
moderator\'s own personal signature file to the end of postings. This
may not be desired and can cause confusion with the original
submitter\'s signature. The moderator should decide what is the most
appropriate way to deal with their personal signature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.5. Creating newsgroup specific headers](#5.5top){#5.5}

A moderator may find that their newsgroup is better served with the
addition of non-standard informational header lines to the individual
postings. This can be done with user-definable \"X-\" headers placed in
the [RFC
1036](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc1036.html)
header portion of the article or by creating auxiliary headers as the
[comp.sources](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:comp.sources).\*
groups have done.

Source newsgroup moderators have established additional headers whose
sole purpose is to support the posting of source code, automatic
archiving and index creation.

Auxiliary headers do not appear in the [RFC
1036](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc1036.html)
\"News\" header section of an article. Instead they are the first lines
of the article text separated from the news headers by a single line
containing a newline. The actual article text is then separated from the
auxiliary headers by another single line containing a newline.

In either case, the moderator should inform the newsgroup of the purpose
and use of the new headers. This should be done in the periodic policy
posting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.6. Receiving submissions](#5.6top){#5.6}

Submissions are received by the moderator as mail. Although it is
possible to use a personal mailbox, it is not advisable. The moderator
mailbox should be either a separate account or an alias that points to
the moderator\'s personal account. There are various reasons for doing
this, among them:

-   Filtering on the To: line to separate submissions from other mail.
-   Ease of maintenance when the moderator moves or is replaced.
-   Most important, if it\'s the same mailbox is very hard to tell
    what\'s a submission from what\'s personal mail.
-   \[Others, I am sure\]

Submissions to a moderated group should be automatically acknowledged
when received. This can be accomplished using the deliver or procmail
mail processing packages. The UCB Vacation program can also be used to
generate acknowledgements.

Deliver is available from
[comp.sources.reviewed](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:comp.sources.reviewed)
archives in volume1. Procmail is available from
[comp.sources.misc](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:comp.sources.misc)
archives in volume43. Other mail filtering programs may be used as such
as \'mh\' and the \'filter\' program that comes as part of Elm.

There are procmail auto-reply tools in the [moderators\'
archive](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/moderators/).

## [5.6.1. Articles posted to a moderated group](#5.6.1top){#5.6.1}

There are a couple ways that a reader can submit an article to be posted
to a moderated newsgroup. The reader can post the article to the
moderated newsgroup as if the group was not moderated. If the news
software is properly configured then it will forward the article to the
appropriate moderator for approval. Unfortunately, it is not unusual for
a posting to be lost in a misconfigured news system. Readers then send
mail to the moderator wondering where their article went to. The
moderator has not seen it and has no idea what the submitter is talking
about.

Other problems with encouraging direct posting to newsgroups is that the
article might be cross-posted or might have been sent without knowing
the group\'s moderation status. Another problem that makes directly
posted articles harder to deal with is the duplicate headers problem
described in [Section
16.7](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod16.html#16.7).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.6.2. Emailed submissions](#5.6.2top){#5.6.2}

Moderators should consider encouraging submitters to mail articles to
the submission address directly instead of direct postings to the group.
The benefits are, users are usually alerted to mail problems faster than
news problems, duplicate headers are not a problem and articles received
via email are guaranteed not to be cross-posted. All in all, emailed
submissions tend to cause moderators less grief then do directly posted
submissions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.7. Adding moderator comments](#5.7top){#5.7}

Comments from the moderator, if necessary, should be added in a way that
clearly differentiates the comments from the submitted article. This is
usually done by including comments enclosed in brackets **\[ such as
this \]**. Whether the comments are included at the beginning or
appended to the end of the article does not really matter. It has been
suggested that placing the comments at the end of a posting is better
since it does not interrupt the flow of the author\'s train of thought.

It is also sometimes appropriate to interject comments into the middle
of a posted article; for example, if a post gives a vague reference to
an FTP site, the moderator may wish to add a line with a specific
reference immediately below that paragraph to avoid confusion.

Also moderators should sign the comments, either with their name or some
way to identify the moderator (e.g., *-mod, -editor* or the moderator\'s
initials).

No matter what method is chosen, the moderator should be consistent so
that the group\'s readership can easily locate and recognize the
moderator\'s comments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.8. Submitting articles](#5.8top){#5.8}

The software and process a moderator uses to post to a newsgroup can be
as simple as piping an article through a script from within the
moderator\'s mailer which posts it. It can be as full blown as a program
that creates Auxiliary headers for a source submission and checks for
all sorts of potential name conflict problems and common posting errors.

The moderator should determine what is needed to make these tasks
easier. Taking the time to try to figure out actual posting procedures
can potentially save time every day.

Posting software is available on the [moderator tools
archive](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/moderators/). From
the simplest \"submit\" script to the complication of \"postit\", the
archive has a wide range of posting tools that are there for others to
grab and modify for their purposes. \[See [Section
15](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod15.html)
for the location of the archive.\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5.9. Canceling articles](#5.9top){#5.9}

From time to time you may need to cancel an article. It may be that you
need to cancel an article with forged approval or an article that was
posted in error. Whatever the reason, know how to cancel an article so
that when the need arises you are prepared to cancel it quickly and
correctly. To cancel an article, create a cancel message and post it the
very same way the article was originally posted. The From: and Sender:
headers need to be the same as they were in the original article. Take
the Message-ID: of the article being canceled and make it the cancel
header by \"Control: cancel \<message-id>\".

You should use the same Newsgroups: line as the original, and you must
have an Approved: line, otherwise it\'ll get submitted to the moderator
for approval.

You might choose to make the Subject: contents the same, but it is not
necessary. Finally, if you provide your own Message-IDs for your
articles make sure that you give the cancel message a new Message-ID.
For example, to cancel this message:

Post this cancel message:

Also put a note in the body of the cancellation message explaining why
you cancelled the article. This is normally just a one-line comment.

There are scripts in the [moderator tools
archive](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/moderators/) to
assist in canceling articles.

## [5.10. Where to find other documentation on moderation](#5.10top){#5.10}

News programs communicate with each other according to standard
protocols, some of which are described by RFCs. RFC stands for Request
For Comment, but for many of the RFC\'s it might be better described as
Requirements For Compliance. Many of the RFCs describe de-facto
standards in the Internet Community. They are a form of a published
software standard. Copies of RFCs are often posted to the net in the
group
[comp.doc](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:comp.doc) and
obtainable from archive sites such as ds.internic.net.

Current news-related RFCs include the following:

-   [RFC
    1036](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc1036.html)
    [[\[1\]](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod22.html)]{.small}
    specifies the format of Usenet articles.
-   [RFC
    2822](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc2822.html)
    [[\[2\]](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod22.html)]{.small}
    specifies the format of mail messages; RFC 1036 uses this. This RFC
    obsoletes RFC 822.
-   [RFC
    977](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc977.html)
    [[\[3\]](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod22.html)]{.small}
    specifies NNTP, the Network News Transfer Protocol.
-   [RFC
    1123](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc1123.html)
    [[\[4\]](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod22.html)]{.small}
    amends RFC 822.
-   [RFC
    1153](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc1153.html)
    [[\[5\]](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod22.html)]{.small}
    specifies the digest format some groups use.
-   [RFC
    2980](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc2980.html)
    [[\[6\]](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod22.html)]{.small}
    Common NNTP Extensions, Specified extensions to RFC 977.

Henry Spencer has a draft of a successor to RFC 1036 that attempts to
document and explain all subsequent enhancements and existing practice
as implemented in the newer news systems. This draft (often called
son-of-1036) can be obtained by anonymous ftp from ftp.zoo.toronto.edu.
Son-of-1036 is intended to be stand-alone reading and does not require
that one also read RFCs 2822 or 1123.

The IETF\'s Usenet Article Standard Update Working Group (usefor) is
actively working to create an official update to RFC 1036. More
information on the working group, as well as the group\'s archives are
located at
[http://www.landfield.com/usefor/](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/usefor/).

Kent Landfield is currently developing an FYI describing Sources group
moderation.

Chris Lewis maintains an FAQ that suggests a format for an FAQ.

[FAQs: A Suggested Minimal Digest
Format\"](/web/20071021065323/http://www.landfield.com/faqs/faqs/minimal-digest-format/preamble.html)

It is periodically posted to
[news.admin.misc](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.admin.misc)
and to the groups
[news.software.readers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.software.readers)
and \*.answers.

It is also probably a wise thing to re-read the documents that are
posted from time to time in
[news.announce.newusers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065323/news:news.announce.newusers)
so that you are aware of what the rest of the community is seeing. It
may have been a long time since you last read those articles and they
have changed over the years.
