## Appendix A: Usenet Specific Newsgroup Moderation Information {#appendix-a-usenet-specific-newsgroup-moderation-information align="CENTER"}

## [Appendix A: Usenet Specific Newsgroup Moderation Information](#ATOC){#A}

For new Usenet newsgroups, draft charters and moderation policies should
be made clear in the Request For Discussion, and final versions should
be in the Call For Votes. The process of creating new Usenet newsgroups
is discussed in

[\"How To Create A New Usenet
Newsgroup\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/usenet/creating-newsgroups/part1/)

posted periodically to
[news.admin.misc](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/news:news.admin.misc)
and
[news.answers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/news:news.answers).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [A.1. Discussion lists for Usenet moderators](#ATOC){#A.1}

Two mailing lists have been set up to facilitate communication between
moderators. They are described below. These lists are there for your
benefit. Use them. New moderators may feel worried about showing their
ignorance in front of the list of their new found peers. Don\'t! These
lists are there to help new Usenet moderators. Usenet moderators are
generally extremely helpful. Don\'t try to struggle through when a
simple request will make your new tasks easier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [A.1.1. moderators-advice](#ATOC){#A.1.1}

The group \'moderators-advice\' was formed from a volunteer group of
Usenet moderators in Fall of 1993. The goal of this group is to come up
with some practical general guidelines for moderated groups on Usenet,
in the form of a moderators\' handbook (this FYI).

One of the goals of \'moderators-advice\' group is to assist, guide and
answer questions for moderators of Usenet. To facilitate this process,
this document has been compiled. It is hoped that this document gives
basic information and general guidelines about the moderation process.

If you have general questions about the moderation process please send
them to moderators-advice prior to posting to the entire moderators
mailing list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [A.1.2. moderators](#ATOC){#A.1.2}

A general discussion list for Usenet moderators is:

[moderators\@isc.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/mailto:moderators@isc.org)

All changes \-- additions, address changes, deletions:

[moderators-request\@isc.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/mailto:moderators-request@isc.org)

The traffic on this mailing list varies. Most of the time it is low or
quiet, if some discussions starts, it may go up to several messages a
day. Almost all Usenet moderators subscribe to it.

Incoming Usenet moderators are normally added by default.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [A.2. Changing moderators](#ATOC){#A.2}

The official list of moderators is maintained by David Lawrence
\<tale\@isc.org>. The list is posted periodically to the newsgroups
[news.lists](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/news:news.lists),
[news.groups](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/news:news.groups)
and
[news.answers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/news:news.answers).
It is titled

[\"List of Moderators for
Usenet\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/moderator-list/part1/)

When a change occurs, the current moderator needs to send a message to:

[moderators-request\@isc.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/mailto:moderators-request@isc.org)

indicating the change to be made. The following information must be
supplied:

-   The name of the new moderator(s)
-   An address where requests and administrative info should be sent.
    Normally this address is \"FOO-request\" for submission address
    \"FOO\".
-   The address for submissions to the list. It is better if this is not
    the name of the newsgroup itself, but something similarly
    descriptive.

The message to initiate the change should only be sent when the old and
new moderators are ready to actually make the switch.

It is best if the new moderator also sends a message to the address
listed to say hello. This will help speed the change.

David will update the list and mail it out to all sites acting as Usenet
moderator mail forwarders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [A.3. Usenet moderator replacement concerns](#ATOC){#A.3}

In the past, it has generally been decided (though not quite
unanimously) that a moderator may not be removed by the group\'s
readership. This topic is a recurring one on the moderators mailing list
where there are those who feel Usenet needs a way to remove moderators
who have quit supplying their services to a newsgroup or who are
otherwise not fulfilling their duties in a satisfactory manner. To date
there is no accepted process for removing a moderator.

When a moderator has not been posting for a very long time the
readership can get angry at the moderator and their inactivity. Members
of the readership have also become vocal when the moderator failed to
follow the charter of their group when selecting articles to post to it.
Whatever the reason, when this happens members of the group\'s
readership have flooded associated groups with \"Off with their head!\"
or \"The moderator of \'your.group\' is a worthless \... !\" messages.
Things start to get ugly at this point.

Most moderators when confronted with this situation will try to find a
peaceful way out. It may be that a polite message posted to your group
explaining the reason such as \"real work has gotten in the way and it
is temporary situation\" will calm the troubled savages. The solution
may entail finding a co-moderator/backup to assist with the workload or
find a permanent replacement. Some moderators just ignore these types of
problems and continue as if the complainers do not exist.

The later approach does have problems that you should be fully aware of.
A rabid readership can\'t really knock you out of the moderator position
but they can damage your net.reputation with barrages of constant
complaints in unmoderated discussion groups relevant to the one you
moderate. You may end up spending time responding to messages when you
could be using that time to post to your group. In any case, be prepared
for a nasty situation if you chose to ignore the problem.

In the end, you must make your own decision on how to deal with the
problem. But please remember that your group is a net.resource to many
people and when it is not functioning smoothly, it is not useful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [A.4. Group Charters](#ATOC){#A.4}

These are important! \*Don\'t\* lose \'em. They often come in very handy
when it\'s necessary to quote chapter and verse to a recalcitrant
loudmouth. And if you wish to make changes to it, make sure that you get
some sort of public consensus that the changes are reasonably
acceptable.

For recently created Usenet groups (since sometime in 1990), group
charters are available at

[ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/news.announce.newgroups/](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/news.announce.newgroups/)

They are archived by hierarchy and newsgroup name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [A.5. Submitting articles through public Usenet Mail/News gateways.](#ATOC){#A.5}

If you do not have direct access to Usenet news, you can still moderate
a Usenet newsgroup. This can be done by submitting articles to the group
via electronic mail, instead of posting them directly to the group.
There are a several \'public\' mail/News gateways. Each one has their
own ways for addressing syntax. The three most common ones are:

-   Site:
    [cs.utexas.edu](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/file://cs.utexas.edu/)\
    Syntax: newsgroup-name\@cs.utexas.edu\
    Example: To send to the newsgroup
    \'[comp.compilers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/news:comp.compilers)\',
    address the message to

    comp-compilers\@cs.utexas.edu

-   Site:
    [newsbase.cs.yale.edu](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/file://newsbase.cs.yale.edu/)\
    Syntax: newsgroup.name-news\@newsbase.cs.yale.edu\
    Example: To send to the newsgroup
    \'[comp.compilers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/news:comp.compilers)\',
    address the message to

    comp.compilers-news\@newsbase.cs.yale.edu

-   Site:
    [pa.dec.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/file://pa.dec.com/)\
    Syntax: newsgroup.usenet\@pa.dec.com\
    Example: To send to the newsgroup
    \'[comp.compilers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/news:comp.compilers)\',
    address the message to

    comp.compilers.usenet\@pa.dec.com

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [A.6. Usenet Moderated Newsgroup Archive List](#ATOC){#A.6}

This article, posted monthly in
[news.lists](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/news:news.lists),
lists the location, maintainer and other general information about the
archives of moderated newsgroups. In most cases, the archives listed are
the location the moderators of the individual newsgroups consider
official. Those that are not considered official but are available are
marked with a **\'\*\*\'** on the Newsgroup: line.

This is not an all encompassing list of archives for each group. Only
the archives that the moderators consider official or one recommended
archive for the newsgroup is listed. It is solely up to the moderator as
to which sites are to be listed. Updates to this listing will only be
allowed from the newsgroup\'s official moderator as listed in the
periodic posting titled

[\"List of Moderators for
Usenet\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065506/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/moderator-list/part1/)

maintained by tale\@isc.org (David C Lawrence).

Moderators, to submit additions or changes, send email to:
