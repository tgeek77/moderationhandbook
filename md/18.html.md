#### NetNews Moderator\'s Handbook {#netnews-moderators-handbook align="CENTER"}

## [18. Answers to general questions](#18) {#answers-to-general-questions align="CENTER"}

[**Sections:**]{#18TOC}

[18.1. How big is my group\'s readership ?](#18.1)

headers?](#18.2)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [18. Answers to general questions](#18TOC){#18}

The following section is a frequently asked questions list with answers.
They are listed in no particular order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [18.1. How big is my group\'s readership ?](#18TOC){#18.1}

Use to be the best way to determine readership was via the newsgroup
reports that were posted monthly by Brian Reid \<reid\@pa.dec.com> to
[news.lists](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065216/news:news.lists).
This is no longer supported. The real answer is **\"Guess\"**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [18.2. What mechanisms guard the group from unauthorized \"Approved:\" headers ?](#18TOC){#18.2}

None. The best process is for the moderator to read the group from
another site and cancel anything posted to his/her group by
\'outsiders\'. (You should try to do it from another site, in general,
because the type of person who posts their own stuff to a moderated
group frequently puts your \"official\" site in the Path: line in an
attempt to keep you from seeing the posting.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [18.3. Have any moderators gotten paid for what they do ?](#18TOC){#18.2}

Yes. Sometimes a moderator\'s employer understands the importance of
news moderation, and the effort involved in doing a good job, and allows
the employee to perform some moderation tasks during working hours, or
on the employer\'s equipment. This potentially gives the organization
greater visibility through an Organization: header or signature file in
the moderator\'s postings. While the moderator is not being directly
paid for moderation duties, their normal compensation covers time spent
working on the newsgroup.

The group
[comp.research.japan](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065216/news:comp.research.japan)
received a grant from the U.S. Office of Naval Research to help support
the operation of the group. There have been other research oriented
groups that have received support, but to-date moderation is usually a
volunteer position with no compensation other than a grateful community.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [18.4. Why are readers complaining of lost articles ?](#18TOC){#18.4}

A complaint a moderator hears from time to time concerns lost
submissions. There are several reasons for these complaints.

-   The reader is unaware of the group\'s moderated status

    The reader replies to an article or submits a new one and does not
    see it appear within minutes in the newsgroup they are reading, as
    is the case for unmoderated newsgroups.

    Solution: Advertise the moderation status in the newsgroup in the
    group\'s periodic posting.

    Solution: A somewhat more effective solution is to use a moderated
    newsgroup .signature file. That way, new readers will be much more
    likely to see it than even a weekly periodic posting.

-   Reader turnaround expectation time

    A reader may wish to see the article reviewed and posted even before
    the moderator gets to it.

    Total Turnaround time, barring unusual network problems, may be
    calculated as follows:

    **T = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4**

    T1 == Time for the submission to the forwarding site for the
    newsgroup from the site it is submitted \[ 0.5 day \]

    T2 == Time for the submission to be processed at the forwarding site
    and transferred to moderator\'s email address \[ 0.5 day \]

    T3 == The suggested turnaround time by the moderator \[ X days \]

    T4 == Time a submission will take after posting at moderators site
    to propagate to the authors \[ 1 day \]

    T = 2 days + X days. For example: If a moderator has a turn around
    time of 1 day, it can take up to 3 days for an article to re-appear
    at the submitter\'s site.

    Solution: Make the total expected turnaround time available. Readers
    will know to wait before complaining their articles are lost.
    Request they wait at least \'T\' time before flagging their articles
    as lost.

-   Misconfigured local news software

    Readers may complain that they are posting/sending articles which
    the moderators never see. None of the articles from that site ever
    reach the moderator(s). It is possible the site was configured
    correctly and in an update to the software something went wrong and
    articles no longer reach the moderators.

    Solution: If all the previous options have been exhausted. Ask them
    to pursue the following:

    1.  Send a test submission. \[if it fails continue on\]
    2.  Talk to news\@\_user_site for an explanation.
    3.  Talk to usenet\@\_user_site if news\@\_user_site fails to reach
        a human being.
    4.  Talk to root\@\_user_site for mailer logs to check if the
        submissions are going out of the site.
    5.  In the meantime, request the reader to post through an alternate
        way by sending submissions to:
        -   Mail2News gateways. e.g., group-name\@cs.utexas.edu,
            group-name-news\@starbase.yale.edu
        -   email submission directly to the moderator\'s submission
            address

-   Reader continue to complain

    At this time, don\'t rule out the possibility of readers
    intentionally creating the problem make moderator(s) appear
    incompetent or to appear as \'victimized\' by the moderators or any
    political agenda of their own.

    It is recommended, moderators be upright and honest and inform the
    readership of what is being down to track the lost articles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [18.5. Readers complain of articles being deleted after a day](#18TOC){#18.5}

Every system that runs the news software has its own set of article
expiration times set by its news administrator. The admin sets the
expiration period depending on how many groups they carry and how much
disk space is available. As a full news feed is over 100 MBytes a day
and rising, some groups are set to expire very rapidly. That is probably
what is happening to the articles your users are worried about. Most
news admins expire articles faster in groups they think are less
important, to make space for those they think really matter. For
example, some sites keep alt. groups only 1-2 days but keep the comp.\*
groups much longer.

Tell the readers having the problem to talk to their local news admins.
Most will extend the life of a particular group their users say they
find important to them.

There is a way that you can indicate that your articles should not be
expired so quickly as the rest - the Expires: header. However, this
should not be used for normal articles as it is not reasonable to try to
override the local news admin\'s policy on how to use the limited disk
space on their systems. If your group has an FAQ or other regular
monthly information posting, though, you may like to use the Expires:
header on that article - look in
[news.answers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021065216/news:news.answers)
for lots of [FAQ
articles](/web/20071021065216/http://www.landfield.com/faqs/), many of
which will have an Expires:

Note however that, partly because of misuse of the Expires: header in
the past, some systems no longer support it and expire all articles at
the same rate. The only real way your users can be sure of keeping the
articles long enough is for them to get the support of their local news
admin.
