------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [16. News transport gotcha\'s](#16TOC){#16}

There are a few quirks in the network news transport software that you
might encounter, and should be aware of. What follows is far from a
complete list but does include the ones most commonly encountered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [16.1. Line lengths](#16TOC){#16.1}

The [NNTP reference
implementation](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025645/http://www.academ.com/academ/nntp/)
package in use on the Internet has a limit on the number of characters
that an individual line may contain. Submissions containing lines longer
than 512 bytes will be corrupted because the reference servers will
truncate the lines longer than 512 bytes.

In general you should limit your individual line lengths to 79
characters or less if possible. Systems that have fixed record lengths,
such as some BITNET IBM servers, can drop text longer than that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [16.2. Old C News blanks-in-ng bug](#16TOC){#16.2}

If there is a newsgroup line in an article like this

**Newsgroups: comp.unmoderated, comp.moderated**

some older versions of C News fail to skip the space after the comma and
so only see the group \"comp.moderated\" which of course is not
moderated and passes it along. When the message hits a B News site, the
space is squeezed out, the moderated group is seen for the first time
and the message gets mailed in. This has been fixed in later C News
releases, but sites running older software will still act this way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [16.3. B News non-local unapproved articles bug](#16TOC){#16.3}

As mentioned in [Section
5](/web/20071021025645/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/mod05.html),
most news servers will automatically forward unapproved postings to the
moderator. This should only occur for local postings, otherwise,
situations can occur where the moderator gets far more than one copy of
the same article. B News forwards non-local articles too. This coupled
with the old C News blanks-in-ng bug has been responsible for moderators
being deluged with hundreds of copies of an article. It\'s particularly
nasty when the newsgroup has been recently unmoderated and not every
server has respected the control message and the ex-moderator gets
bombed.

To be fair, the B News behavior of mailing unapproved non-local articles
to the moderator was not a \"bug\". It was a \"feature\".

It used to be that B News was the only game in town. It used to be that
people ran ancient software versions forever. In such an environment, it
was useful for a site receiving an article that should have gone to the
moderator to assume that the previous hosts were running old software,
and do the moderator-send itself. That is not the case today.

This bug has not been fixed, and never will be because B News is no
longer being supported. Fortunately, B News is dying out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [16.4. Article size concerns](#16TOC){#16.4}

In some places, such as small systems and news-to-mail gateways, there
are problems when individual article sizes exceed software limits. We
need to either remove builtin system limitations or work around them.
Since it takes time to remove old software versions and overcome
hardware limitations netwide, the best course of action is to work
around the limitations so that the news will get to all sites.

Individual postings should be less than or equal to 60K. If it is
necessary to split the posting into multiple parts, each part should be
less than or equal to 60K. This is due to the architecture restrictions
of some older systems. This restriction is more in the minds of the
users on the net than the software running it. Postings of 90K
successfully make it through most present day news systems. Many mail
systems have limitations of 100K on messages that pass through them.
This is a concern because there are news to mail gateways that deliver
and post news via electronic mail.

Note that some commercial gateways to the Internet have broken news and
mail software that truncate anything over around 25K. Most are in the
process of correcting their sub-standard software but at this point that
has not been universally accomplished.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [16.5. Amount of messages posted daily](#16TOC){#16.5}

Moderators of high volume newsgroups should try to limit the amount of
data posted per day so as not to flood news spool directories on smaller
systems. A good rule of thumb is to limit posting to 800K per day if
possible.

If you are overwhelmed with posts on one day, it may be better to hold
some articles back until the next day. Articles can be posted either in
chronological order, or grouped by subject. On the other hand, it is not
a good idea to loosen your acceptance standards simply because fewer
articles were submitted in a given time period - in most cases it is
better to have lower volume than lower quality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [16.6. Cross-posting to other moderated groups](#16TOC){#16.6}

None of the NetNews software handles cross-posted moderation very well,
largely because there is no consensus on what the correct action is.
What actually happens is that the posting software picks one of the
moderated groups more or less at random (usually the first moderated
group) and mails the message to its moderator. If the posting software
used by the moderator who received the article does not check for other
moderated newsgroups, the article will appear in the newsgroup of the
other moderated group without being approved by the appropriate
moderator.

Moderators should try to bullet-proof the posting software by making it
check cross-posting to multiple moderated groups. But until NetNews gets
a far more sophisticated posting scheme, e.g., one that lets a moderator
add a new newsgroup to a message already in circulation, glitches like
this will happen.

Remember that it is often VERY desirable to cross-post among moderated
newsgroups:

Many of the postings in
[news.answers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071021025645/news:news.answers)
are cross-posted into the group from other moderated groups.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [16.7. Extra headers on directly posted articles](#16TOC){#16.7}

Some submissions will arrive with two sets of headers. The \"real\"
headers will be a set of generic mail headers; the news headers will be
included as text within the body of the mail message. Even worse, in
these cases the mail headers may indicate that the article is \"From\"
usenet\@site or news\@site, making it difficult to identify or respond
to the actual author.

This is the article-headers-in-body problem caused by C News feeding the
article into UCB Mail or mailx instead of /bin/mail, which usually
incorporates the news headers into the mail header.

Explanation: in C News, the newsbin/relay/injnews script is used by
inews to do site-specific header bashing. When it discovers the
newsgroup is moderated, it invokes mail to send off the article to the
moderator (via mailpaths). Unlike B News and INN, where time has been
spent to configure how to use the mail transport directly (to merge the
news headers in with the mail headers), C News blindly punts the article
into \"mail\" which is a user agent, which often refuses to accept
\"header-like\" stuff at the beginning of a message as part of the [RFC
822](/web/20071021025645/http://www.landfield.com/rfcs/rfc822.html)
header block. In essence, mail will often implicitly put a blank line at
the beginning of the message, so the headers carefully crafted by
injnews end up as part of the body instead of the mail headers.

If this becomes a problem for you, it would be appropriate to send a
message to usenet@ and/or postmaster@ at the offending site with a
suggestion on how to fix their C News injnews script.

\[See [Appendix
B](/web/20071021025645/http://www.landfield.com/usenet/moderators/handbook/appendixB.html)
for a description of the solution. A template message is included that
will allow you to inform the offending site of both the problem and the
solution.\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [16.8. Multiple copies of the same submission received](#16TOC){#16.8}

There are a number of different reasons why you may get many copies of a
submission:

-   A mailer or gateway bug that keeps resending the same message
    (distinguished by having the same sites in \"Received by\" headers).
-   The posting site doesn\'t have the group marked as moderated
    (usually you only get a few extra copies of the message, all with
    short \"Path\" headers, if any).
-   Interaction with the C-news problem when there is a space in the
    list of newsgroups; when it gets to a B-news site, the space is
    squashed out and the moderated group is recognized (there are
    multiple newsgroups in the header, and your moderated group is not
    the first in the list).
-   Submitter was unaware that the group was moderated and repeatedly
    attempted to post the article to the group since their article did
    not immediately appear in their local newsgroup.

Contacting the administrator of the site where the problem posting was
generated is probably a good first step.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [16.9. B News static Newsgroup: header limit](#16TOC){#16.9}

B News inews has a static limit of 256 bytes for header lines. One might
think that this limits Newsgroups: headers to about 254 bytes, but
unfortunately the practical limit is lower than that. The Xref: header,
which is generated from the Newsgroups: line plus article numbers, is
longer than the Newsgroups: header. If the Xref: header at a particular
site is longer than 256 bytes, the article simply will not appear at
that site.

Since the length of the same article\'s Xref: header varies from site to
site, and cannot be easily computed in advance, it is necessary to leave
some spare room in the Newsgroups: header. Set a fair limit on the size
of the Newsgroups: header, and make a policy prohibiting cross-posting
to more groups than will fit on the line. Some moderators have decided
on a 200-character limit for the entire Newsgroups: line.
